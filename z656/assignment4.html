<li>How many lists are in the article text?
<p>There is 1 list. Found with the XPath: count(//list)</p></li>
<li>How would you isolate the copyright statement (Copyright 2013 Trustees of Indiana University)?
<p>/TEI.2/teiHeader/fileDesc/publicationStmt/availability/p[1]</p></li>
<li>What are two different ways to isolate the publisher and pubPlace elements together (Indiana University Libraries Bloomington, IN)?
<p>/TEI.2/teiHeader/fileDesc/publicationStmt/*[position() < 3]</p>
 <p>/TEI.2/teiHeader/fileDesc/publicationStmt/publisher,pubPlace</p></li>
<li>How many paragraphs are in the text of this article?
 <p>There are 34 paragraphs in the text of the article.</p>
 <p>count(/TEI.2/text//p)</p></li>
<li>What different states are mentioned in the text?
<p>Indiana, Ohio, South Carolina, Kentucky, Arkansas, North Carolina. Plus "Monroe" which is miscoded as a state. </p>
 <p>Retrieved with the XPath: distinct-values(//region[@type="state"]/@reg)</p></li>
<li>How many distinct cities are mentioned in the text? Hint: use distinct-values()
<p>25 cities. distinct-values(//settlement[@type="city"])</p></li>
<li>How many times does "Evansville" appear in this article? Hint: use ctrl+F to check your work
<p>Evansville appears twice. Retrieved with the XPath: //settlement[@reg="Evansville"] </p></li>
<li>What's your best guess for how to figure out how many book reviews there are in this article using XPath alone?
<p>count(//p/hi[@rend="i"]/following-sibling::lb[1])</p>
<p>Find the <hi> with @rend="i" for which the following sibling is an <lb> tag, then it finds only the first <lb> sibling in order to count the title only once. Then, count them all. </p>
<p> This XPATH retrieves 18 results. </p></li>
