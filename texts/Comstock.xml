         <div type="chapter">
            <p>ELIZABETH L. COMSTOCK was the daughter of William and Mary Rons,of Maidenhead,
               Berkshire, and was born there October 30th, 1815. She spent more than half her
               eventful life in America, and the last time she was in England, some nine or ten
               years ago, dictated the commencement of an autobiography, from which, and her
               nnmerons interesting letters, the following- pages are compiled.</p>
            <p>We will quote first from the former : — It has been truly said that " Everyone's life
               is a Story "; the first page of my life's story was opened at the little country town
               of Maidenhead, in Berkshire, England, six miles from the Royal Palace at Windsor.</p>
            <p>In the lull that succeeded the battle of Waterloo, when peace was restored to the
               European powers after their long conflict, and Napoleon's restless spirit was chafing
               on the rock-bound Island of St. Helena, my eyes opened upon my mother's face, beaming
               upon me with loving admiration. I was her first girl, the oldest of seven daughters —
               one little brother had preceded me, and another followed two years later, over whose
               birth I rejoiced exceedingly, and in my excess of love nearly ended his life
               prematurely. Wishing to share with him a rosy apple that had been given me, I went to
               his cradle and awoke him, saying " Baby, bite,". and tried to thrust it into his
               mouth; and a few days 'later eame still nearer choking him with a tiny biscuit, which
               I succeeded in forcing in, thinking it " just the size for baby to eat." Some
               exploits of this kind made my dear mother willing to spare me to a kind aunt, who
               kept a school near us, for two or three hours daily, so that my literary education
               may be said to have commenced very early, and also some more domestic lessons. In
               later life, I found some letters written from this aunt to my mother, acknowledging
               the receipt of a pocket-handkerchief, " hemmed by little Elizabeth, at two years
               old," which she thought an extraordinary performance for so young a child. To this
               dear aunt I was indebted for instruction during several years of my childhood, until,
               when in my ninth year, on May 20th, 1824, I left home for the Friends' School, at
               Islington. My dear mother took me to London Yearly Meeting on the way, and there for
               the fir,st time, I had the privilege of listening to that eminent servant of the
               Lord, Elizabeth Fry. I shall never forget the impression she made upon my young mind
               by her sweet voice, beautiful face, and her earnest pleading, as she spoke of the
               prisoners, the suffering and the outcast. I was too young to under- stand one half of
               what she said, yet good seed was sown then and there, which led to active labour in
               after years. In the solemn silence that followed, after she took her seat, my
               childish heart was lifted in the prayer that I might grow as good as she was, and
               work in the same way. Although an unusually wild, wilful, and playful child, yet in
               my most sacred and secret moments, I returned to the prayer of nay childhood, and
               these impressions were deepened every time I had the privilege of seeing and hearing
               her in after years. Among the early and pleasant impressions of my childhood, are my
               dear mother's teachings. On one occasion, as I walked beside her along the banks of
               the Thames, she talked to me about the rushing river and the mighty ocean, the
               majestic trees and the lofty hills, and the powerful Hand that made them all; of the
               sun, moon and stars, and the Heavenly Father, " Who planned and formed, and still
               upholds a world So fraught with beauty, for rebellious man."</p>
            <p>A sensation of awe, accompanied by something like discouragement, came into my
               childish heart, which I expressed to my mother with a fear that He would not care for
               a little child like me when He had so many great and wonderful things to attend to.
               She replied by lifting me up to see a bird's nest in the hedgerow, and explaining to
               me that God taught the little bird to build its nest, and to rear its young; and then
               bade me pluck a little flower at my feet, and pointed out how nothing was so small as
               to escape His notice. Who gave the violet its life and nourishment, its fragrance and
               beauty.</p>
            <p>My dear father took great delight in seating me on his knee, and talking to me of the
               truth and beauty of the distinguishing views of the Society of Friends, which he had
               joined when quite a young man. Many an hour I have listened with great interest as he
               told me of the cruel persecutions and great sufferings of the early Friends. He took
               pains to impress upon me the utter nselessuess of water baptism and other outward
               ceremonies, telling me that he was once baptised with water, and was much
               disappointed to find that it did not wash away a single sin, or help him at all, in
               his efforts to be good. Of the horrors of war, he often spoke, and of the sinfulness
               and cruelty of slavery. His narrative of Leonard Fell was so vividly impressed upon
               my mind that I have never forgotten it. Leonard Fell, son of Margaret Fell, returning
               from meeting, one Sunday evening, and passing along a solitary road, was suddenly
               attacked by a highwayman, who seizing the bridle rein, demanded " Your money or your
               life." The young Friend immediately took out his purse and handed it to him. As he
               did so, the robber, seeing seals and watch-chain, became bolder, and presenting his
               pistol again, demanded " Your watch or your life." The watch was immediately given
               him, and emboldened still more by this, and thinking he had only a coward to deal
               with, he became still bolder, and presenting his pistol again, said "Your horse or
               your life." The young man dismounted, and the robber mounted the horse, and would
               have ridden ofl[, but Leonard Fell took hold of the bridle rein, and began to
               expostulate with him on his sinful course, preaching to him, " of righteousness,
               temperance and judgment to come."</p>
            <p>Again the pistol was presented, with the threat " If you do not stop, you are a dead
               man," but without paying any regard to his threat, our young Friend continued his
               earnest words of rebuke and exhortation,, to the great amazement of the robber who
               exclaimed, I thought you were a coward — yon gave me your money, your watch, and your
               horse to save your life, and now you have nothing more to lose, you risk it standing
               there, preaching to me." Leonard Fell's reply is worthy of being written in letters
               of gold.</p>
            <p>"Though I would not risk my life to save my money, my watch, or my horse, yet I will
               risk it to save thy soul."</p>
            <p>The man dropped his pistol, listened to the words of the young preacher, dismounted,
               restored all he had taken from him, and with tears of contrition confessed his sin,
               gave a sad detail of his past life, and the circumstances that had led him to such a
               course, how he had taken to drinking, lost his work and his character, and when going
               down hill, found everyone ready to give him a kick, so he had gone on from bad to
               worse, until with a sickly wife and starving family, he had been driven to his
               present life. Leonard Fell gave him his address and promised to provide him with work
               if he would forsake his evil ways and abstain from licjuor. He did so and became a
               changed character, and henceforth lived industriously and honestly. How mutch better
               than if the life of either had been sacrificed!</p>
            <p>In the conversations with my father, he would sometimes mention John Rous, one of the
               early champions of Truth, as held by Friends, who married Margaret Fell's daughter,
               and suffered such cruel persecution both in England and New England, having his right
               ear cut off for returning to the latter country after being banished. In Sewel's "
               History of Friends," we read of some of John Roiis's family settling in Suffolk,
               which being my father's native county, he thought we were probably descended from the
               same good stock, and he imbued my young heart fully with the idea that such ancestry
               was infinitely superior to being able to prove our descent "From loins enthroned, and
               rulers of the earth."</p>
            <p>The following is a story w^e heard from our dear father. We called it "The stolen
               hides." William Savery, an eminent preacher in the Society of Friends, was a tanner
               by trade, and known by all as " one who Avalked humbly with his God." One night a
               quantity of hides were stolen from his tannery, and he had reason to believe that the
               thief was a quarrelsome, drunken neighbour, whom I will call John Smith. The next
               week, the following advertisement appeared in the county newspaper, " Whoever stole a
               quantity of hides on the fifth of the present month, is hereby informed that the
               owner has a sincere wish to be his friend. If poverty tempted him to this false step,
               the owner will keep the whole affair secret, and will gladly put him into the way of
               obtaining money by means more likely to bring him peace of mind."</p>
            <p>This singular advertisement attracted considerable attention, but the culprit alone
               knew Avho had made the kind offer. When he read it, his heart melted within him, and
               he was filled with sorrow for what he had done. A few nights afterwards, as the
               tanner's family were retiring to rest, they heard a timid knock, and when the door
               was opened, there stood John Smith, with a load of hides on his shoulder. Without
               looking up he said, ''I have brought these back, Mr. Savery; where shall I put them?"
               ''Wait till I can get a lantern, and I will go to* the barn with thee; then perhaps
               thou wilt come in, and tell me how this happened. We will see w^hat can be done for
               thee."^ As soon as they were gone out, his wife prepared some hot coffee, and placed
               pies and meat on the table. When they returned from the barn, she said, "Neighbour
               Smith, I thought some hot supper would be good for thee." He turned his back to her
               and did not speak. After leaning against the fire-place in silence a few moments, he
               said in a choked voice, *• It is the first time I ever stole anything, and I have
               felt very bad about it. I am sure I didn't once think that I should ever come to what
               I am. But I took to drinking^ and then to quarrelling. You are the first man that has
               ever offered me a helping hand. My wife is sickly^ and my children are starving. You
               have sent them many a meal, God bless you ; and yet I stole the hides. But I tell you
               the truth when I say it is the first time I was ever a thief."</p>
            <p>"Let it be the last, my friend," replied William Savery. " The secret remains between
               ourselves. Thou art still young, and it is in thy power to make np for lost time.
               Promise me that thou wilt not drink any intoxicating liquor for a year, and I will
               employ thee to-morrow on good wages. Thy little boy can pick up stones. But eat now,
               and drink some hot coffee. Perhaps it will keep thee from craving any- thing stronger
               to-night. Doubtless thou wilt find it hard to abstain at first, but keep up a brave
               heart for the sake of thy wife and children, and it will soon become easy. When thou
               hast need of coffee, tell Mary and she will always give it thee."</p>
            <p>The poor fellow tried to eat and drink, but the food seemed to choke him.</p>
            <p>After vainh' trying to compose his feelings, he bowed his head on the table and wept
               like a child. After a while he ate and drank, and his host parted from him for the
               night with the friendly words, " Try to do well John, and thou wilt always find a
               friend in me." . . . He entered into his employ the next day, and remained with him
               many years, a sober, honest, and faithful man. The secret of the theft was kept
               between them, but after John's death, William Savery sometimes told the story to show
               the power of that love for God and man which the Gospel of Christ inspires. Would to
               God that all men w^ere as wise, as patient, as eager to do good, as much like Christ
               as he was !</p>
            <p>One of my chief troubles at school arose from the difficulty of observing the very
               strict rules, a long list of which was read to us once a month; and here I will bear
               my testimony against the practice, then so sadly prevalent, of inflicting so many
               strict rules upon little children. One of them was " not a word to be spoken from the
               time the bell rang, at 7.30 p.m., for evening reading, until we came dowmstairs the
               next morning." This silent system I constantly transgressed, for it was impossible
               for a lively chatterbox of nine years to keep quiet so long. Monitors were a23pointed
               in every room to watch and inform against those who talked, and punishment followed
               every transgression of the rule. This encouraged deceit, and led to artful modes of
               communication, which might elude the vigilance of the monitors. Another evil
               resulting from this Spartan- like code of laws was, that we no sooner heard them
               read, than we felt a desire to break them, proving that now, as in days of old, " sin
               cometh by the law."</p>
            <p>Thus, the rule forbidding us to walk on a certain low wall, bounding our playground,
               at once suggested an inclination in my wayward spirit to mount the same, which I did,
               being the ringleader of a dozen more, who followed in my track. For this
               transgression, my "disobedience received a just recompense of reward," for I was
               sentenced to solitary confinement until I had committed to memory the twelfth chapter
               of Romans. Another regulation was that no one should get on the top of a high chest
               of drawers, which stood in the girls' schoolroom. A few days after this was read,
               some of my schoolfellows dared me to climb it, and to prove to them my bravery, I
               soon accomplished the feat, and was seated on the top when governess suddenly made
               her appearance in the room, and, with look and tone of severe displeasure, ordered me
               to stay there until permitted to descend, and, in this uncomfortable and ignominious
               position, the gazing-stock of all who came into the room, I (justly) remained for an
               hour or two.</p>
            <p>Another of these written laws forbade us to climb a fine chestnut tree at the lower
               end of the playground. Xo sooner was this new rule made, than a number of us,
               standing under the tree, gazed up with longing looks at the delightful seats among
               its umbrageous branches that we could find for sitting sheltered from the sun, with
               our fancywork or our reading : enjoying this stolen pleasure, with several others,
               for many an hour have I sat, perusing " Pilgrim's Progress," the only interesting
               book that was allowed us, while one of our playfellows would watch and give notice of
               the approach of teachers, I taking my turn as sentinel. Thus were seeds of deceit
               broadly sown through onr school by stringent rules.</p>
            <p>Before going to school I had not been a dainty child, but soon after entering,
               received my first lesson in this direction. I was told that only the poor children
               liked the rice pudding, so with childish vanity, and a strong wish to support the
               respectability of my family, I soon took a dislike to it, and fancied I could not eat
               it. Sometimes the rice was boiled, and not very thoroughly, and I really found
               difficulty in swallowing the hard grains, and made a bargain with Hannah, the girl
               who sat opposite to me at table, that if she would eat my rice pudding for me at
               dinner, I would give her my treacle at supper. For a long time, this transaction was
               regularly carried on between us on a Tuesday. Should this ever meet her eye, she may
               accept my cordial thanks for the friendly help so long and constantly rendered,
               although on that day, I not only gave away my dinner, for we had only pudding, but
               had nothing but dry bread for supper. On one memorable occasion, Hannah being absent,
               and the pudding being worse than usual, very hard and dry, I could not eat it, and
               after one or two vain attempts to swallow it, was left behind with a good many others
               in like predicamenr. We were all required to clear our plates, and eat the ^vhole of
               our first helping at dinner, ^vhether palatable or not : one of the teachers
               remaining vrith us. As she ^valked to and fro in the dining-room, I learned another
               lesson in artfulness from my next door neighbour, who. when the teacher's back was
               turned, deposited a spoonful at a time of her pudding into a handkerchief in her lap,
               which example I quickly followed, and soon the whole of my rice was transferred to my
               pocket from my plate, and I was allowoil to leave the dining-room, the teacher
               supposing I had eaten it. At the playroom door, I was met by a merry group, waiting
               for me to join in their play, and in the noisy, eager game of •* I spy," I forgot all
               about the contents of my pocket. In the afternoon school, the monitor called out my
               name for talking, and a bad mark was given me; when I rose to make excuse that I was
               speaking necessarily, another mark was added. A feeling of indignation at the
               injustice, drew from me the exclamation. " It is a shame," w^hereupon, I was called
               from my seat, and made to stand at the teacher's table. A burst of tears led me to
               draw forth my pocket-handkerchief, when behold, in full view of the whole school, and
               all of the teachers, the rice rattled down, and scattered all over the open space
               between the teachers' tables and the girls' desks. A solemn silence followed, in
               which we might have heard a pin drop anywhere in the room. Happily for me, governess
               was absent from the room, receiving, in the teachers' parlour, a visit from the
               gentleman to whom she was engaged to be married. I stood all the afternoon, in great
               fear of her appearance, but, thanks to her friend, she did not come; and after
               school, one of the girls swept up the rice, and threw it away.</p>
            <p>One of our favourite amusements at School, was playing at meeting and preaching. I
               had the reputation of being an excellent mimic, but not quite so distinguished as my
               school-fellow Susan, who was particularly clever in imitating an aged minister,
               concerning whom, a tradition was current amongst us that he generally spoke from the
               text "Every tub must stand upon its own bottom." This preacher was very peculiar in
               his delivery, very tall and so upright as to lean a little backward, and bring his
               hands down with much emphasis upon the gallery-rail, in his loud vociferations. One
               evening we had retired earlier than usual, as cleaning was going on downstairs, and
               had received the permission, very seldom accorded, to converse in our bedrooms — the
               teacher's parting charge as she left the room was that we should not talk very loud,
               and only on serious subjects. This was followed on our part by a request that Susan
               would "give us a sermon, as there is no talk so serious as sermons." She at once
               complied, to our exceeding amusement, and as the tall girl standing up, just visible
               in the moonlight, brought down her hands upon the bed-rail, with the emphatic words,
               and the peculiar manner, "Every tub must stand upon its own bottom," a merrj- peal of
               laughter rang through the room, which reached the ears of the governess below, and
               "G.G.," "G.G.," (great governess) was whispered round the room,while the sound of her
               advancing footsteps silenced the noise, so that when she entered our bedroom, Susan
               was in bed, and apparently fast asleep — and I was the only one Avhose laugh she
               detected. My risible faculties were of such a nature that it ahvays seemed easier to
               me to laugh, and more difficult to stop laughing than to my school-fellows. Advancing
               to the foot of my bed, governess severely demanded "Elizabeth, what art thou laughing
               at?" If there was any character that was specially despised among us, it was a
               tell-tale, and therefore I was silent. After the question had been repeatedly asked,
               wdth no reply, I was ordered to get dressed and accompany governess downstairs. There
               I was again plied with questions, but assuming the heroic, I resolved that torture
               should not draw the cause of my laughter from me. After repeated severe reprimands,
               she seated me at the end of one of the school-room desks, and giving me a Bible,
               directed me to read m that and see how wicked it was to be making fun and amusing the
               girls when we ought to have been engaged in self-examination and devotion.</p>
            <p>Instead of using my Bible for the purpose named, I began seeking for the text Every
               tub must stand upon its own bottom,*' and trying to find out the circumstances under
               which it was first spoken — in vain — and have since learned that it is not a
               Scripture quotation at all, but the language that Bunyan puts into the mouth of one
               Presumption, whom he found sleeping at the foot of the Hill Difficulty.</p>
            <p>While thus engaged, the whole scene came so vividly before my mind that I again
               laughed aloud, to, the great indignation of my governess who was within hearing, and
               immediately came to me, reproved me severely and took the Bible away, saying I should
               not make fun of that any longer, put out the light, and left me alone in the darkness
               and in tears, to think over and repent of my sin. There I remained until ten o'clock
               at night. The following Saturday, in play afternoon, we amused ourselves wdth holding
               meeting. We selected for our meeting house, a shady spot beneath the spreading boughs
               of the chestnut tree, as far removed as possible from the teachers' parlour. Our
               favourite preacher was called upon to occupy the puljDit, which was an empty
               w^ater-butt turned upside down. Susan mounted, and raising her hands and eyes, and
               elevating herself to her utmost height, as she in a very emphatic manner, brought
               down her hands on the bough of the tree which made an admirable gallery-rail, she
               gave out her text in a stentorian voice, Every tub must stand upon its own bottom."
               As she spoke, the head of the cask fell in, and she made a most ignominious descent
               into the depths below, leaving nothing visible but the upper part of her face — loud
               and long continued was the merry laughter that followed, but being holiday afternoon,
               no evil results ensued, or enquiries as to our laughter.</p>
            <p>The next morning in meeting, unfortunately for me, as subsequent events proved, I
               occupied a verj- conspicuous place, the third seat from the aisle, and facing the
               ministers. We had sat some time in silence when the minister mentioned before rose,
               and with his peculiar manner, which we had seen so cleverly mimicked, gave out his
               text, Every tub must stand upon its own bottom." This was too much for my risibility,
               and I laughed aloud. The preacher stood as if spell-bound; had he been turned to
               stone he could not have been more silent. The solemnity that followed was awful to
               me, as the governess left her elevated seat at the side, came to me, and led me out
               of meeting, a poor little culprit of eleven years old, led down the aisle in solemn
               silence in the presence of about 300. I felt the disgrace most keenly, and as though
               I should never be able to lift up my head again as long as I lived. Without a word
               she led me back to the school. I thought that if she had scolded me, or shaken me, or
               even beaten me, I should have preferred it to this awful silence. She took me into
               the house, through the hall, up the stairs, and locked me up in a closet. After
               meeting, I was brought down into the teachers' parlour, where a solemn assembly was
               gathered — the two ministers, two elders, two of the committee, the superintendents,
               governess, and some of the teachers, numbering in all eighteen, like the judge and
               jury, and I the prisoner at the bar before them, trembling and weeping. The first
               command given me was, " Put thy hands behind thee," a thoughtless charge to give to a
               child with eyes swollen and red with weeping. Next came the query, " What didst thou
               laugh at? " It would have been impossible for me to explain had I been disposed to do
               so, and I had determined to implicate no one. Each of the members of this solemn
               conclave by turn addressed me; I do not remember what one, two, three, and four said,
               but seventeen and eighteen will never be forgotten. Number seventeen charged nae with
               being guilty of the same offence that the children of old committed who mocked
               Elisha, reminding me of the awful judgment that followed, when the bears came out of
               the wood and tare forty-two of them. I was so terrified that for a long while after I
               could seldom walk in a lonely place or through a wood without some fear that I might
               hear the growling of a bear. I knew enough of natural history to understand there
               were no wild bears in England, but did not know what miracle might be wrought for my
               especial case. The illustration was the more forcible, as glancing timidly at the
               preacher, I noticed his head was very bald. Number eighteen compared my fault to the
               sin of Belshazzar, in making light of sacred things, in allusion to his sacrilege in
               using the holy vessels of the Temple for his feast. In after years it has seemed to
               me that this was very far-fetched, but at that time I was much frightened, and when
               taken upstairs again and locked in the dark closet, I hardly dared open my eyes lest
               I should see a hand writing on the Avail. I was con- demned to solitary confinement,
               with only bread and water for food, and what was worse still to me, to sit by
               governess in meeting until I would tell what made me laugh.</p>
            <p>After sitting there three meeting-times, and having through excessive crying to go to
               bed with a bad head- ache directly I got back to the school, on the morning of the
               fourth meeting-day, Susan found me weeping at one of the schoolroom desks, and said
               to me, "Elizabeth. Rous, I do think thou art a little simpleton." This I felt "the
               cruelest thrust of all." I turned upon her with indignation, saying that if I had
               told of her, she would have been in punishment instead of me. She replied, " Well, I
               do think thou art very foolish; here for three meeting-days thou hast sat by
               governess, cried so much, and made thy head ache so badly, and had to go to bed
               directly after meeting. If thou hadst had a spark of sense, thou wouldst have had the
               headache before meeting. I am sure thou hast a bad headache now." Whereupon she took
               me to L.B., one of the kindest and most sympathizing of the teachers, and said to
               her, " This poor little thing has a dreadful headache, she was sobbing and crying all
               night, and kept all the girls in our room awake; may she go and lie down? " This
               appeal was rather a stretch of Susan's eloquence, but it met with a kind response
               from the teacher, who put her arm round me, and, with a loving kiss, said, " Poor
               child ! I am very sorry for her, but her case is under the care of the ministers and
               elders, and of the committee, and I don't dare to interfere."</p>
            <p>L.B. kindly allowed me to go and lie down till meeting-time, and Susan saw me
               comfortably in bed, and left me with the charge, " Now, of course, thou won't hear
               the bell ring for meeting, and if anyone comes to call thee, snore loud enough to let
               them know thou art fast asleep." I must soon have fallen asleep, as the next sounds I
               heard were those of the girls taking their things off after meeting. Whether they
               forgot me, or relented and thought my punishment too severe, I know not, but this was
               the last I heard of the matter, and here ended my playing at meeting and
               preaching.</p>
            <p>1n reference to the foregoing, it is due both to my teachers and schoolfellows to
               explain that the former would not have been so severe had they known the
               circumstances, and they thought me incorrigibly obstinate for refusing to tell what I
               laughed at; and, being cut off from all communication with the latter while I was in
               disgrace, I had no opportunity of explaining to them, or they would have cleared me,
               and Susan herself would have explained all.</p>

         </div>
         <div type="chapter">
            <p>ELIZABETH ROUS left Croydon School, after attaining the first place in it, in 1829 —
               and ten years after returned there as a teacher. Her unfailing energy and excellent
               spirits made her a great favourite among her pupils. She was not only the teacher,
               but the sharer of their out-of-door games and their indoor amusements. She often
               accompanied them in long walks through the pretty country around, Croham Hurst and
               the Addington Hills beiug frequently chosen for their afternoon strolls.</p>
            <p>In 1812, she went to Ackworth, where she had charge of the senior class of girls, and
               where, as at Croydon, she was much beloved by her pupils. She enjoyed their
               companionship both in the playroom and schoolroom, and was ever ready to give up her
               time to help them; while her desire for their best welfare was sincere and earnest.
               Her sense of the responsibility attached to the teacher's calling increased and
               deepened. To one of her sisters who was about .to join the teaching staff at
               Ackworth, she wrote in 1814 :— "Let us strive together to serve the Lord. Let this be
               our constant aim; let us have no greater . pleasure, no more powerful attraction that
               might draw our hearts and our affections from Him and from His service. Let ns be one
               another's help nnd strength in the Lord. We may have trials and conflicts and bitter
               cups to drink yet, but we can drink them together; we can bear one another's burdens;
               we can watch over one another for good."</p>
            <p>Under date 18-6-1846, E. R. wrote from Ackworth to her sister, then at Croydon, . .
               "But my dear C. it requires no small qualification to be fit for an Ackworth or a
               Croydon teacher either; the longer I live, the more I feel the importance and respon-
               sibility of the position. A little circumstance has occurred which has made me feel
               this just now with increased weight, and as I think it calculated to convey a lesson
               of instruction to all teachers, especially to young and inexperienced ones, I hand it
               to thee. During the recent hot weather, the girls have given a good deal of trouble,
               in getting or wishing to get water, before going to bed. One evening they were spoken
               to all together, and told they could have as much water as they wished before
               reading, but none on any account, after. On the very next evening, one of the young
               teachers brought two little girls to me with the complaint that they had been into
               the wash-house for water, instead of going straight to bed. The teacher who told me
               spoke as though much vexed with the little delinquents, whom she had been blaming in
               no very gentle terms for their disobedience. When she left them with me, I took them
               one in each hand, and led them to sit down by themselves, instead of going to bed
               with the rest, telling them as I did so, that I was very sorry to have to punish
               them, for that I had noticed them particularly during the week, as behaving unusually
               well. They were generally very giddy and disorderly though interesting little
               creatures, and I had several times commended them for their care and watchfulness
               over themselves during this week. When I made the above remark to them, I left one
               sitting in the schoolroom alone, and was about to leave the other in the playroom,
               when she burst into tears, and sobbed and seemed so much distressed that I did not
               like to leave her, and sat down by her on a box to have a little conversation with
               her. I am truly thankful that I did this, for by it, I was prevented from committing
               an act of great injustice, by punish- ing these little ones, and I fear to think of
               what might have been the consequence in their state of mind, had I done as 1 was
               going to. By my talk with little J., I found that she and M. E. had been under very
               serious impressions, that they had yielded to them, and were striving to be good
               children, lambs of their Saviour's fold, that they had spoken to S. E. W. (one of the
               teachers) on the subject, and asked her to let them go to her every night to tell her
               how they had behaved during the day, whether they had talked or been disorderly, or
               done anything wrong, etc. On the evening in question one of them had some flowers in
               her hand, which the teacher who brought her to me said she had been to her garden
               for. It was quite a mistake; they had not been to get water, they had not been to
               their gardens. They had been told that S. E. W. was in the wash-house, they looked in
               to see, and did not enter, they got no water. The little girl who had the flowers,
               shall speak for herself. After I had heard the explanation about the wash-honse, I
               asked her, ' My dear M. E., why didst thou go to thy garden after reading? thou knew
               that was wrong.'</p>
            <p>"M.E. I did not go to my garden, please."</p>
            <p>"I. Then where didst thou get those flowers?"</p>
            <p>"M.E. I got them before reading, and laid them there," pointing to a shelf.</p>
            <p>"What for, dear?" said I.</p>
            <p>"Tears again started into the dear child's eyes, and into mine too, as she replied,
               'S.E.W. has been very kind to me, and I thought she would like some flowers out of my
               own garden.'</p>
            <p>"After dismissing the dear little lambs to their respective bedrooms, I retired to my
               own, to pour out my full soul to Him who sees the heart, and judges not by the
               outward appearance.</p>
            <p>"While I thanked Him for not permitting me to commit an act of injustice, I bewailed,
               with bitter tears, my own weakness and my liability to err in this way, through
               ignorance of what the children were feeling and thinking. And earnestly did I commit
               it to His especial guidance, who alone knoweth the heart, that he would watch over us
               all, and over our precious charge, that we might never be permitted in ignorance, to
               punish unjustly, or to check any good work in the heart of the lambs committed to our
               care. I felt relieved when I left my bedroom, but this circumstance and the narrow
               escape that I felt I had had, rested upon my mind. It has already been of use to me,
               and I trust will be yet of greater use. May it be a lesson to thee, too, my dearest,
               not to condemn too easily from outward appearance, and not to judge or punish
               hastily. . . . . I hope thou hast settled in again very nicely and cheerfully, since
               I bade thee farewell, and that dear is endeavouring to \valk in the narrow path of
               self-denial, the path which leads to peace."</p>
            <p>Writing from Ackworth again, 21-12-1847, she mentions several cases of indisposition
               in the school, and continues, " I have just been upstairs with the girls, a quarter
               at a time, to see the remains of their late dear school-fellow, C.E. It is a solemn
               sight to see this young and lovely flower so soon cut off, transplanted, I trust, to
               a heavenly garden, there to bloom for ever. She looked very beautiful. Dear Thomas
               Pamphrey, governess, and I were present while all the children went in to the chamber
               of death. T.P. sweetly addressed them, and told them a little about the last hours of
               their young companion. He spoke of the hodij so soon cut down, told them that C,
               after hearing of her danger, had, in conversation with him, quoted those two
               lines,</p>
            <p>"The body ! little is its worth, " Oh ! let it mingle with the earth ! "'</p>
            <p>but that all her concern was for the soul. During the very few hours that elapsed
               between her being informed of her danger, and the summons going forth * Prepare to
               meet thy God,' she was twice heard, as if in earnest prayer, to utter the words '
               Forgive me ! oh forgive me ! ' She was conscious to the last, her close was
               remarkably quiet, as though sinking into a sweet sleep. She had hold of my hand when
               her spirit took its flight from the weak tenement. The last who died in that room,
               was our dear sister Mary.* T.P. and I were forcibly reminded of that event, as we
               watched the dying bed of this sweet lamb."</p>
            <p>Elizabeth Rous left Ackworth in 1847, on her marriage with Leslie Wright, who about
               this time, had given up a lucrative business from conscientious motives, and had
               taken a market garden at Waltham- stow, in Essex.</p>
            <p>Before this they had had some thought of settling in Ireland, and re-opening a school
               there which had been closed for some time. She went over to make enquiries and wrote
               thus of her trip. " and very kindly met me at the station, and went on board and
               stayed half an hour with me before the steamer started.</p>
            <p>"The evening was very rough, and both wind and tide against us. The stewardess
               greeted me with the tmwelcome intelligence * we shall have a blustering night, and
               get late to Dublin.' To my great satisfaction when seated in the saloon, feeling
               quite disconsolate, I saw a Friend seated near me. A member of our Society amidst
               forty other passengers, all men, was quite cheering. He soon made himself known to
               me, and in the course of half an hour, we were in a very interesting and animated
               conversation about Ireland, Irish character, and Irish schools. ... I Mary Rous,
               mistress of the Monitorial School, died at Ackworth, in November, 1843, in her 21st
               year, sat talking with this Friend until half-past eight. Tea and coffee, &amp;c.,
               were then set out, and having had nothing since dinner, I enjoyed a good meal. This
               over, I withdrew to my cabin, staggering as well as I could, the motion of the vessel
               being considerable. I got into bed, and being weary, soon fell asleep. After awhile,
               it seemed an hour or two, I awoke, and was much puzzled to find that all motion had
               ceased. All around me was perfectly silent, but over-head was a fearful noise, so
               much running, shouting, &amp;c., I was quite alarmed. There was also a noise of steam
               escaping. I can't tell thee all the thoughts that rushed into my mind, but amongst
               others most prominent, was the recollection of 'the loss of the Kent,' and the vivid
               description of the stillness in the cabin, and the absence of all motion, that takes
               place when a vessel is * settling previous to going down.' That we might be in that
               position seemed more than probable. I heard now and then a deep groan, which seemed
               to proceed from some one in an adjoining cabin. I endeavoured to stifle all
               excitement, and to get as quiet in mind as possible, and by no means disposed to add
               to the tumult upon deck, feeling assured that if the steamer was ' going down,' I
               should be as safe in my berth as on deck, and more tranquil. After lying very still
               for awhile. Indulging these thoughts, I heard my name pronounced by S. M. with an
               enquiry after me. ' How truly kind of him to think of me, at such a season of danger'
               I thought, and starting up, I called out, *What is the matter? ' The Stewardess
               replied * We're in.' ' In what'? I enquired, with some alarm, picturing to myself
               whirlpools, rocks, and all sorts of dangers lo voyagers. ' In Kingston Harbour.' ' In
               Kingston Harbour, impossible,' said I, ' we've been so short a time.' ' We have been
               longer than usual,' was her reply, ' it is after seven o'clock.' I now started up in
               reality, and with the greatest possible speed got dressed and off by the half-past
               seven train to Dublin, and thence by car to the other terminus to start for C — , but
               too late; the train started at eight o'clock, and I arrived at three minutes past
               eight. Greatly annoyed» I set out on a two miles' walk to the Imperial Hotel to make
               enquiries, in reply to which I found that I could not get to C — to-day. So I tried
               to feel resigned to circumstances and to hope it might all prove for the best. . . .
               After walking about for an hour, I found our friend 's house, received a hospitable
               welcome, and am staying till to-morrow morning when I hope to catch the early
               train."</p>
            <p>Soon after her marriage she wrote to one of her sisters : — " My snug, quiet little
               home continues much the same as when I last Avrote. Nothing has occurred to break the
               even tenour of our way. We are very retired. We have had no visitors since our
               brothers and sister left, and we have not been out at all except to meeting. L. finds
               his hands pretty full whenever the weather admits of his being in the garden, and I
               find plenty of occupation, amusement, and pleasure in the house, at Jiome, without
               going elsewhere to seek it. . . . Peace be with thee, dear C. ! That peace which the
               world can neither give nor take away, and may each succeeding birthday, find thee
               progressing in that path of self-denial, prayer, and watchfulness which will lead
               thee ultimately to an incorruptible inheritance in the land where that Peace will
               meet with no alloy. Do not misunderstand me, I would not imply that any good works or
               any care, &amp;c., on thy part would be sufBcient to take thee there. Thou art w^ell
               aware that there is but One who can enable thee to steer clear from the snares that
               encompass thy path, and guide thee to that Kingdom of rest and peace. May He be with
               thee and guide thee, and guard thee, and do thou commit thy way unto Him, in full
               confidence ado^jting the language 'My Father, Thou art the guide of my youth.' "</p>

         <div type="chapter">
            <p>A FEW months subsequently, she went into business at Bakewell in Derbyshire. After
               writing of some household cares, E.L.W. continues, "How well is it for those who in
               the season of adversity can flee for refuge to 'The Rock,' until the storm has passed
               over; who can cast their burden upon the Lord,' and feel his sustaining arm. I look
               for the Rock, but it seems far off, and so dense a cloud of doubts, anxieties, and
               cares intercept my view that it is dimly seen, and I cannot draw near enough to
               repose under its shadow, or to find 'a covert from the storm.' While at Kettering I
               thought I might learn an instructive lesson from contemplating the characters of M.E.
               and A. They always look tranquil. We do not often see them laugh, but they often
               srnile and always look tranquil, and whether in sorrow or in joy, they remind me of
               the words, ' Nothing shall harm you if ye be followers of that which is good.' They
               seem really to possess ' quiet from God.'</p>

            <quote> "How beautiful within our souls to keep This treasure the All-merciful hath
               given, To feel when we awake, and when we sleep, His incense round us like the breath
               of heaven. Quiet at hearth and home, Where the heart's joys begin, Quiet where'er we
               roam, Quiet around, within." </quote>
            <p>I can see its beauty, hut 'it is high, I cannot attain unto it.'"</p>

            <p>In after years we cannot doubt this high attainment was hers in an eminent degree,
               and in telling others of that "incense round us like the breath of heaven," she
               herself experienced that " quiet from God," that " peace which passes all
               understanding."</p>
            <p>In 1854, she emigrated with her little girl to Canada. Her youngest sister
               accompanied them, and wrote a graphic description of their voyage in the " Sarah
               Sands," from which a few extracts are given below. Steamers did not cross the
               Atlantic forty years ago so quickly as they do now, and they were nearly three weeks
               on their way. Contrary winds and rough seas, occasionally, did not prevent much
               enjoyment in their novel circumstances. The " wonders of the deep " called forth
               their admiration from day to day, and the rolling of the vessel sometimes occasioned
               amusing and ludicrous scenes on board, "gentlemen crossing the deck in two strides,
               ladies congratulating themselves on having walked, or rather staggered, in safety to
               the head of the cabin stairs, suddenly finding themselves on their knees at the foot
               of them, others luxuriating in real genuine salt shower baths, given gratis by the
               spray; folks tumbling about in all directions, gentlemen going over each other as
               though they were playing at leapfrog, ladies, standing or sitting conversing
               together, suddenly thrown into each other's arms with most affectionate force,
               stewards hurling tureens full of soup from one end of the saloon to the other,
               stewardesses throwing teapots full of tea into the cabins, instead of placing them on
               the table; cups, saucers, and teaspoons running races, all making a tremendous
               clatter, and Mrs. 'Sarah Sands' herself staggering from side to side, like a teetotum
               that's tired of spinning, and just going to fall — she also amused herself with
               submerging the tops of her bulwarks in the water, first on one side and then on the
               other. The captain and officers called it 'a stiffish gale,' and one of the
               passengers exclaimed, ' If they don't look sharp about those sails, they'll have her
               on her beam ends directly.' The wind had risen so suddenly, and the heavily falling
               rain and sleet so completely saturated the thick, ponderous canvas, that the sailors
               found the sails rather refractory. However, I believe there was no sort of danger,
               for the captain W'as coolly smoking a cigar, with his hands in his pockets, while
               issuing his orders alternately to the man at the wheel and to those aloft in the
               rigging."</p>
            <p>A few days after — " About four p.m. an iceberg 'hove in sight,' and the passengers
               inclining to pay it a visit, the ca^^tain took us seven miles out of our way, and we
               passed within 200 yards of it, between nine and ten p.m. The captain estimated its
               height above the water at 300 feet, but said six-sevenths of it were submerged He
               said also that it was the largest he had ever seen, and he had ' had more experience
               with icebergs than he liked.' I wish I could describe it to you properly — it was so
               magnificently grand and transcendently glorious, the stars shining with the most
               intense brilliancy, and' the moon looking as fiery as the ' red planet Mars ' in his
               hottest moods, and the Aurora literally spanning the firmament with its arrowy
               lustre, looking only one degree less cool and white than the iceberg itself.
               Everything seemed cokl, quiet and grand, even the vessel seemed awed into more steady
               behaviour than usual, so that we could stand and admire, and offer real pure heart-
               homage, without bodily obeisance." On the following day — " To-day we are in the
               region of icebergs; there were six visible before breakfast, and most beautiful they
               looked, and very cold we felt, but the air was so pure and bracing, and, although
               some of the passengers called it a ' Canadian day,' the sky was certainly an *
               Italian blue.' A fortnight since we left Liverpool, and ' no land yet '; we have had
               unusually adverse winds, and our engine is so small that one of the passengers
               remarked that when the wind is ahead, the engine has no power to take us forward, but
               merely prevents our going back. . . . Xo vessel is allowed to come up the St.
               La\trence without a pilot accustomed to the coast, on account of the many hidden
               rocks and reefs; the captain said having to take a pilot would cost him £16. In the
               afternoon a pilot-boat appeared in sight, and soon sent off one of her crew in a
               small boat to us. During the evening service on Sunday, we were in rather a perilous
               position for a few minutes, owing to a sailing vessel (notwithstanding all our lights
               were hoisted, and the captain, mate and pilot shouting at the top of their voices to
               those on board her) crossing our path, within two yards of our bows; had we struck,
               it is considered one of the vessels would inevitably, and most probably both, have
               gone down — how thankful ought we to be to that Allwise Pilot who mercifully steered
               us clear of each other ! Great credit was due to Captain Ilsley, who was as usual at
               his post, and showed great skill, energy, decision and self possession."</p>
            <p>At ten minutes before twelve a.m. on the fourth of September, 1854, the captain gave
               the order * let go the anchor,' the chain rattled, the anchor slipped down into the
               water, and we were standing still in the midst of more magnificent scenery than we
               had ever beheld, or even dreamed of, in our most extravagant day-dreams. There stood
               Quebec, that city of cities, surrounded by hills, or rather mountains . . . We had a
               good view of the Citadel, and also of the (late) Parliament Houses — they are now in
               ruins, being burned down about a year ago. Here we left the ' Sarah Sands ' and went
               on board the ' New Era ' a fine steamer, saloon 220ft. long, and luxuriously
               furnished — this conveyed us to Montreal, a large city with 75,000 inhabitants and
               its Roman Catholic Cathedral, said to be the most splendid building in North America.
               Here we again changed steamer for the ' Bay of Quinte,' which took us to Kingston,
               passing through the ' Lake of the Thousand Isles,' the scenery most beautiful. The
               islands, of all shapes and sizes, seem composed of masses of rock, out of which grow
               various flowers and shrubs, though it seems wonderful how they can find support."</p>

            <p>At William Mullet fs, Huntingdon, near Belleville, 10-9-1854.</p>
            <p>OUR introduction to this land has been very promising, encouraging bright hopes for
               future comfort. After posting my letter at Kingston, our voyage in one of these
               splendid floating palaces up the beautiful and winding Bay of Quinte, was very
               pleasant. We reached Belleville at nine p.m. John Mullett, William M.'s nephew, met
               us upon our arrival at the wharf, and accompanied us to the hotel where we lodged,
               and called upon us next morning at eight o'clock to see whether he could render us
               any service. He is a tanner, and keeps a currier's shop at Belleville. Before
               breakfast, L.A. went to the post, and returned, to my great delight, with four
               letters, which we very much enjoyed. You must know what it is to emigrate to a
               distant land, to be 4,000 miles from your country and your beloved relatives, before
               you aan fully understand the joy we experienced, and the eagerness with which we
               perused those letters. We have gone through them twice, and shall soon commence a
               third reading. 11th — We called on Sheriff Moodie. As we drew near his house, he came
               forward, and shaking hands with the greatest cordiality, said, 'I think I can't be
               mistaken, is it not Mrs. Wright? ' A hearty welcome to Canada followed, and an
               introduction to his house, wife, daughter and son — the former looked like a
               comfortable, real, English home, the latter three, all cordial, affable and
               agreeable. After an hour or two spent pleasantly with them, we accepted the kind and
               urgent invitation of our friends William Mullett and wife, and came over here. Next
               morning we went to look at the town — houses are never long to let here, it being a
               thorough go-ahead place, rapidly increasing in population, especially now they are
               making a railroad to join the Great Western Rail, w^hich goes right through West
               Canada to London, and on to Lake Huron. I am rather disappointed by the first sight
               of Belleville, and do not like it so well as Bakewell, though it is very much larger.
               There is one principal street, a mile-and-a-half long, and several smaller ones
               intersecting it at right angles; also another, parallel to the best, of an inferior
               rank. But the best does not come up to the best street at Henley, the buildings being
               rather irregular, and streets narrow. Some houses are of brick, some stone, some
               wood, some a combination of all. The rents in the best part of the town are very
               high, but in the back streets we may get a house for a trifle. We cannot learn the
               population of Belleville, having enquired of many persons, and received very varied
               replies, from 3,000 to 30,000. I fancy 10,000 or 12,000 is near the mark in the
               actual town, but the suburbs and surrounding villages and townships would equal five
               or six times the population. There is no town so large within eighty miles, Kingston
               being the nearest, and all the large and widely-scattered population make Belleville
               the central point, and go shopping there.</p>
            <p>. . . . Everything we have heard since coming here encourages the idea that
               Belleville is the right place for us, except one, and that is to me a very serious
               one, there is not a Friends' meeting here. There are a few Friends' families residing
               four miles from Belleville, but they go twelve miles to meeting William Mullett and
               wife belong to a very large family — their fathers are both living, fine old men,
               eighty-five and eighty-seven. One of them tells me his children and grandchildren
               number ninety-six. They have intermarried very much, three sons of one family having
               married three daughters of another. They all seem to live in the greatest unity,
               harmony and love. The cordial greeting that all whom we have yet seen have given us,
               is wonderful. Here w^e are entire strangers, without even a letter of recommendation,
               and they receive us with all the warm-hearted hospitality of near relatives. They —
               the old folks — emigrated from Somersetshire thirty-five years ago, some of the
               family from Ireland. They were fourteen in number. They brought over a small lot of
               merchandise with them, sold it at a good profit, and with the money bought land. They
               had not been at all accustomed to farming, but thought it a pleasant change after
               applying closely to a shop. They say that in Canada it takes a very short time to
               learn how to farm, and, if a man is willing to work, he cannot help succeeding, so
               little labour being required to make a farm produce the necessaries of life. I am so
               amused to see how they manage : neither pigs nor fow^ls are fed — when I ask what do
               they live on, the reply is, ' Oh ! I guess they pick up plenty to eat — corn, apples,
               pumpkins, in abundance.' Then they have most of the skim milk, and scraps left at
               table in great profusion are thrown into the yard for the pigs to help themselves at
               pleasure.</p>
            <p>"This meeting consists of from ninety to one hundred members, some of them living ten
               or twelve miles off. They think nothing of that to ride, but a walk of a mile
               frightens them.</p>
            <p>"They have a good many fine horses on this farm on purpose for riding. The ploughing
               is done by oxen. They pay 6d. per annum tax for a horse, i.e. 4^d. English. Mutton is
               selling here at 3d. a pound, 2id. English money; beef, prime joints, 4d., Canadian
               money 3d. sterling; apples and potatoes so plentiful that a person may almost have
               them for asking. Eggs used to be 3d. a dozen, they are now 5d., very good and fine
               ones ; good cheese, 4^d. Flour is higher now than it has ever been known, owing to
               the great demand for the English and French markets, and a failure in the crops here
               this season ; it is 1/9 per stone of 14 pounds. We have not yet seen any pine-apples,
               but melons and peaches in abundance, and very large pumpkins.</p>
            <p>"Now let me introduce ' mine host ' to my dear sisters and brothers. He is a plain,
               consistent Friend, quite English in his manners, language and appearance, a
               well-educated farmer. He and his wife superintended the Friends' School, West Canada.
               He is a grey-haired man of fifty-five, very active, and quite in his prime
               apparently. His wife is his junior by ten years, but looks rather more nearly
               approaching being worn out; a motherly kind-hearted woman, thin, working far too hard
               for her station and her means. But she seems to be most happy when actively engaged
               in her kitchen or dairy. The cows go prowling about the fields at pleasure all day,
               going to the water to drink of their own accord when thirsty, and come when our
               friends call them to be milked. It looks so droll to see E. Mullett and her daughter
               Eliza Maria stand on the doorstep and shout ' Possie,' * Possie,' and jDresently the
               cows come running down the hill.</p>
            <p>"The swine here are far more docile than in England. All the pigs I have seen in the
               mother country persisted in going the opposite way to what their driver wished; here
               they come when called.</p>
            <p>"This house is a square stone building, very strong and pretty looking. The front
               (West) has a balcony or colonnade, all along. On entering the house, we come at once
               into a sort of hall, or keeping-room of the family, a plain, substantial comfortable
               room, sixteen feet by eighteen, ten feet high. It has two windows and six doors. One
               of the latter opens to the yard, in front, and to the stairs, one to the side, one to
               the kitchen, three into bedrooms on the ground floor. Upstairs is a square room of
               the same size, from which three bedrooms open, and the stairs. A kitchen, pantry,
               cupboards, outhouses, &amp;c., complete this specimen of a farmhouse in West Canada.
               The table is heaped with abundance of all that is good; cream, butter and eggs of the
               best quality in particular. The floors are painted or stained oak, not a carpet to be
               seen in the house, all beautifully clean.</p>
            <p>"This Meeting consists almost entirely of thriving farmers and their families. It is
               called Huntingdon Particular Meeting, a branch of Westlake Monthly Meeting. The
               Friends here seem to have a very lively recollection of John Pease's visit. We have
               had many enquiries after him, and the Friends seemed so pleased to hear we had seen
               him just before leaving England. . . . Monthly Meeting at Picton, thirty- eight miles
               distant, will be next week, and W.M. promises to drive us to it in his four-wheeled
               chaise if we will stay. I will post this at Belleville to-morrow, and you will see
               how well we are faring, surrounded by such kind friends — we have met with kindness
               and courtesy from all classes since landing on these shores. Whoever we speak to,
               gives us a kind reply. Women here seem to be treated with much greater respect than
               in England."</p>
            <p>E.L.W. settled in Belleville. It was soon after her arrival in Canada that she felt
               it her duty to speak in our meetings, and this being acceptable to her friends, she
               was recorded as a minister.</p>
            <p>E.L.W. to S. and C.H. Belleville, 21-10-1854. </p>
            <p>"Your very interesting letters have been a rich treat to us. Did you know how welcome
               they are to us in this distant land, you would favour us with them rather more
               frequently. Just now they are particularly acceptable, for I have been feeling
               depressed and lonely. Dear little C. is at Huntingdon, to stay there while we get
               settled in here, probably two or three weeks. Notwithstanding all the kindness we
               have received from all with whom our lot has been cast, yet there are times when I
               feel a sinking of the soul, a loneliness that longs for a communion of spirit with
               those I have loved from childhood; when I feel that I can unite in the language</p>
            <p>'Friends, kindred, home and country — these Are things from which we never part; From
               clime to clime, o'er land and seas, We bear them with us in our heart.'</p>
            <p>My experience since leaving my native land has been more than ever a leaning upon one
               unfailing Friend. Utterly helpless and unable to go forward without His protecting
               and guiding care, ' Hitherto has He helped me ' indeed, and provided friends for me,
               where I had no friends but Himself.</p>
            <p>"The accounts of cholera in England are very distressing. Oh ! that those most dear
               to us may be preserved from it ! I feel much for E.W., and for any one who loses a
               precious child. C. dear, I fully participate in thy enjoyment of thy little treasure,
               and 'his father's too. May he long be spared, and prove a blessing to his dear
               parents. I fear I love my C. too well ! I seem to have mingled with my love, pleasure
               and pride in that precious child, a constant fear of losing her. I feel condemned in
               the conviction that she is too dear to me. . . . Oh, that some of you were here. I
               want to see you and talk to you, to ask you many questions. Solomon Vermilyea, at
               whose house we hope to spend to-morrow, and who will kindly drive us to meeting, says
               that -farming is the best trade in this country,' that he has cleared £800 per annum
               for some time past, after providing abundantly for his large family of twelve
               children. He thinks no previous knowledge of farming needful, to enable a man to get
               a living in this land, but with a previous knowledge, he may soon get rich. This
               Friend is renowned for his hospitality. He likes to see his house full of visitors —
               often has twelve at a time under his roof."</p>
            <p>L.A.R. to C.H.</p>
            <p>Belleville, 9-9-54. "I wish you could have gone to meeting with us yesterday, so as
               to see the trees we passed. I thought them unequalled a fortnight ago, but they were
               then tame compared with their present hues, green, brown, orange, scarlet, yes, a
               brilliant, genuine scarlet, crimson, fiery golden, oh, they are so indescribably
               lovely. As I stood gazing at them yesterday, with my body in Canada, and my spirit in
               England, I almost fancied I could see them change, while I gazed, like the scenes in
               a dissolving view, only infinitely more splendid. Really Canada is a glorious
               country, in its natural beauties, and did not history assure us the Garden of Eden
               was in the East, and America unknown until 1492, I should be strongly inclined to
               believe it was in the backwoods of Canada that Adam awoke from his sleep, and found a
               wife beside him, and the St. Lawrence that was Eve's mirror.</p>
            <p>We are now feeling very anxious to get settled, and I hope w^e may open this day two
               weeks, but it is doubtful. Our * store ' is a good-sized one, and has two windows. It
               is fifty-two feet long, (but we are having a small piece partitioned off at the far
               end, for a ' little back parlour '), and twenty -two feet broad. There is a cellar,
               extending the w^hole length, underneath. It is a good situa tion for business and
               health. The weather is still distressingly warm, the Indian summer has just commenced
               — its chief characteristics are intense close- ness and great haziness in the
               atmosphere; the sun by day and the moon by night look like balls of fire suspended in
               the sky. . . I am learning to milk, and some other out-d oor employments. W.M. and I
               gathered more than eleven bushels of apples between us in one morning, a few days ago
               — really, there is a very independent feeling in being perched on one of the topmost
               boughs of an apple tree, with a clear, blue sky and bright sun above, and rosy fruit
               all around, and when the wind blows, and it did pretty hard one day when we were
               gathering apples, it's capital fun and capital exercise to stick on. I have some
               Indian corn for you — how shall I send it? William Mullet gave m9 an ear, containing
               520 grains — it is so pretty. . . A few days since, I joined a large party of j^oung
               people in a picnic. Our destination was a beautiful spot on the banks of the Moira,
               the river at whose mouth Belleville is situated. The woods were beautiful, and
               afforded me my first introduction to the snakes; we saw two very pretty ones, each
               about twenty inches long — they were striped alternately with a dark olive and light
               yellowish green — they were of a perfectly harmless species. We dined by the water
               -side, table- cloths were spread on the grass, and then covered with knives and
               forks, plates and glasses, and a profusion of appetising dishes. This feast in the
               wilderness was garnished with various leaves, rich in all their autumnal glory, and
               boughs of different sorts arched gracefully across it. . . In the course of time if
               you should be sending us a box, please enclose a bunch or two of lavender, the people
               here do not know what it is, for it * comes out missing' in this country, as also
               daisies and primroses."</p>
            <p>Huntingdon 1-11-54. Our fifth, and, I suppose, last Sunday at Huntingdon for some
               time. Eight weeks yesterday we arrived here, friendless foreigners in a strange land,
               and, really, going to Belleville to-morrow will feel almost like a second emigration,
               we have experienced such ceaseless, ever-varying kindness."</p>
            <p>E.L.W. to S. and C.H. and L.R.</p>
            <p>"You will be pleased to hear that thus far we are bearing the Canadian winter well.
               It is colder than in England, but so bright, fine, light and clear that we do not
               seem likely to suffer from the cold more than in England, though the thermometer
               stands 8^ below zero, and occasionally 11° or 12° — one day last week it was 15°
               below zero. Yet we are all in good health, free from colds, coughs, and chilblains.
               Indeed we quite enjoy the winter. The sleigh rides are delightful. We very often have
               the offer of a ride into the country, and frequently accept it to get to meeting. . .
               . Three Friends have offered to take me to Kingston to our Quarterly Meeting next
               week. It is sixty or sixty-five miles by land — two days' sleigh ride. I anticipate
               going with much pleasure. I can give you no adequate idea of the kindness of the
               Friends here. I believe it is my beiog a widow, with a lovely little girl, that
               attracts their sympathy and love, for both I have received in large measure. Scarcely
               a day passes without some proof of their considerate thought- fulness. . . We get on
               very comfortably altogether, and I am truly thankful that I came here, and shall be
               still more so if you will all come too. Do come ! There is abundance for you all to
               do. I believe we shall promote our comfort in this world by coming, and if we think
               of the future, I may say I never felt so earnestly desirous to dedicate my heart,
               soul, strength and life to the Creator of all the wonders we have seen of late, since
               leaving England. . . . I want to feel less engrossed in this world's affairs, and
               more at leisure to dedicate the strength of my days to Him, who has so helped me, and
               provided friends for me here. Before leaving my native land, I made a covenant with
               Him, that if He would be with me and bless me, and preserve us on our voyage, and
               provide me friends and a home here, that hence- forth my life should, far more than
               ever before, be devoted to Him, and to the promotion of His cause and His truth upon
               the earth. He has fulfilled my desire to the uttermost extent of my wishes, and I
               find peace iu endeavouring to fulfil my covenant. For the most part since leaving
               England my spirit has been preserved in quiet confidence and trust.</p>
            <p>"I wish to get to meeting as regularly as possible, and the great kindness of the
               Friends here in taking me, makes it easy to do so, notwithstanding the distance. They
               drive me to the Quarterly, Monthly, and Particular Meetings, and so I attend as
               regularly now as at any time since leaving Ackworth School. At the close of the last
               Monthly Meeting the wife of one of the ' substantial farmers ' at Westlake, came to
               me and said, ' How glad I am thou art come ! My husband says whenever thou canst get
               to Monthly Meeting he will take thee back, if thou hast no other way, and if thou
               wilt write and tell us whenever thou wants to come and has 7io cTiance^ he will go
               and fetch thee.' Is not this kind? He lives nearly thirty miles off the nearest way,
               that is across ,the bay when it is frozen over, so that we can cross in a sleigh.
               When that is not the case, it will be a journey of nearly fifty miles. ... I wish you
               were all here — you would enjoy this bright, clear, bracing air; it makes one feel
               all alive. Every perception seems awakened to a new and keen enjoyment. Perhaps you
               will think me ungrateful and wanting in natural affection, if I tell you that I have
               tasted more real lively pleasure and enjoyment, peace and tranquillity since
               emigrating, than ever in the same space of time in my life before. . . . C. often
               talks of you all and wishes me to tell you how she likes sleigh rides, and that the
               horses all have a row of pretty little bells across their shoulders. The sleighs
               glide very quietly and very noiselessly, but with great rapidity over the snow. 'Tis
               a pretty sight, a pleasant sound, and delight- ful feeling. Seated completely
               enveloped in buffalo skins, and well muffled up, gliding along on the ground so
               easily, too near the ground for the keen winds to be much felt. There is no way of
               travelling I have ever tried, in England or Canada, so enjoyable as sleigh riding. It
               far surpasses first class railway travelling."</p>
            <p>On January 28th, 1855, she writes, — "We had a tremendous snow-storm yesterday, and
               few people left their houses. We hear that the snow is lying a few miles distant,
               four feet deep, not in drifts, but on a level surface. Persons can ride along the top
               in their sleighs, in a direct ]ine, hindered by no impediments, over three feet
               fences, hedges, ditches, &amp;c. The farmers are rejoicing over this snow, it
               protects the young wheat which was growing too tall, and in danger of suffering from
               frost. Pleasure hunters are rejoicing in the snow, because they can ride about the
               country with so much greater facility. Tradesmen rejoice over the snow because it
               doubles their trade, by ■enabling country people to come more easily to town.
               Residents in the country rejoice to see the snow, because it is so much easier to get
               over the ground, and to take their produce to market, and to stock their little
               country shops from the large Belleville stores. Everyone looks bright and brisk after
               a heavy snow- fall. The very horses seem filled with double life and vigour, as they
               tear over the ground at an incredibly rapid rate with sleighs and cutters, and their
               musical bells in the rear.</p>
            <p>"Winter is the season for enjoyment in Canada. "We do not suffer from the cold at
               all. Dear L.A. and C. are bright and well, and happy, and I am also in good health,
               and truly thankful to the Giver of every good, for all His blessings. This is a
               glorious country. The prospect just now from our door is singular and beauti- ful.
               The whole row of houses opposite have ornamented roofs of spotless w^hite, and a
               handsome fringe of icicles, varying in length from one inch to four feet, average
               perhaps three feet. The sun shines on them at noon, and they glitter and sparkle like
               brilliants. To see the number of people riding past in their sleighs and cutters adds
               to the life and animation of the scene, muffled so closely in buffalo and racoon
               skins, hoods, veils, muffs, boas, victorines, &amp;c., &amp;c., in every variety,
               they seem able to bid defiance to the cold, and look so bright and happy. A
               good-sized sleigh will hold six or eight passengers. A cutter is smaller, adapted to
               carry two only. The latter is more stylish and prettier, but not so warm and
               comfortable as a sleigh. W. M. kindly took me in his cutter to the Monthly Meeting at
               Westlake. We drove three miles on the ice across the bay just as though we had been
               on terra firma. There is a regular track or beaten road, the snow trodden down, and
               we are told the ice is from twelve to eighteen inches thick. Every now and then it
               cracks with a report like distant cannon. This is considered a good sign — I mean a
               sign that the ice is good and firm, because it only occurs when it is so, and seems
               to be a sort of safety-valve to let the confined air escape that has been kept close
               by the solidity of the ice. Much as we admire the beauties of the Canadian winter, we
               shall rejoice in the spring thaw.</p>
            <p>People here are very loyal to our Queen and Govern- ment. There is a feeling akin to
               acrimony towards the Americans, as they call the inhabitants of the ' States,' while
               the latter despise the Canadians. They need not, for Canada is rapidly rising, and
               will soon equal them in all that is worth boasting of.</p>
            <p>I have been interrupted in my writing by a call from Mrs. Moodie (author of 'Roughing
               it in the Bush'). She and the Sheriff are very kind friends to us."</p>
            <p>About this time, to cheer one who had lost a dear friend, and experienced a trying
               change of cir- cumstances, E. L. W. writes, "We read of some who 'knew no changes,
               therefore they feared not God.' I trust none of us may be of that number, but that we
               each one may in sincerity, adopt the language —'I will not waste one breath of life
               in sighing, For other ends has life been given to me; Duties and self-devotion —
               daily dying Into a higher, better life with Thee, Dear Lord, with Thee.'</p>
            <p>"In my own heart's history, I can read some progress during the last eight years'
               changes. At this present time, I know more of confidence in my Heavenly Father's
               love, more of the tranquillity and peace that the world cannot give, than at any
               former period of my life. I hope I am not deceiving myself — I feel that I am not,
               and that my whole soul and spirit are more devoted and dedicated to the service of my
               God than heretofore. Oh ! for an increase of faith and love, and a deeper
               soul-communion with Him, that He may be increasingly, ' the chief among ten thousand,
               the altogether lovely ' to me — to us all. The sense of entire dependence upon his
               direction and protecting care, since leaving my native land, has brought me nearer to
               Him."</p>
            <p>Belleville, 8-11-1855.</p>
            <p>"I am glad you are reading 'Roughing it in the Bush.' It may make you a little better
               acquainted with our adopted country, though 'times are altered' since the publication
               of that graphic volume. The 'City of the Bay' advances in civilization, and bears
               something like an approach to a small country town in our native land, in
               cultivation, refinement, manners, and customs. But the country life twenty or thirty
               miles back in the woods, assimilates itself with sufficient nearness to enable us to
               comprehend Mrs. Hoodie's descriptions. The Sheriff and his lady often call upon me,
               and warmly shake hands with me when they meet me in the street. They invite me often
               to their house, but I have neither time nor inclination to visit, beyond the visiting
               amongst Friends, that getting regularly to meeting necessarily involves. 7-11-55 —
               Day after day passes, and I find very little time for writing. How I wish you were
               all here in Canada, that we could hold communion without writing. . . Provisions are
               pretty high in price just now for Canada. Bread Ihd. per four-pound loaf, Beef 4d.
               per pound, Candles 9d., Sugar, Butter 9d., Cheese 5d. Ham 6d., Eggs Id. a dozen.</p>
            <p>"Thank thee dear, for thy birthday congratulations, they are very welcome though a
               day after time. I had quite forgotten the day, when dear's letter reminded me.
               Amongst other good wishes, she hopes I shall acquire a fortune in ten years, a desire
               in which I do not unite. I believe that wealth in this world and in the next, rarely
               falls to the lot of the same individuals, and my ambition is to gain sufficient here
               to procure a subsistence in this life; and in that to come, ' a house not made with
               hands, eternal in the heavens,' a 7^eal and rich inheritance * that fadeth not away,'
               one of the many mansions promised to the followers of the meek and loivly and humble
               Carpenter's Son, not a wealthy gentleman, or rich merchant or noble peer. I hope I
               have not already comforts enough to weaken my faith and dim my sight of the glories
               there, but I take the words literally and in their fullest sense, 'How hard it is for
               a rich man to enter the Kingdom.' 'It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of
               a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God.'</p>
            <p>"Therefore my dear sisters, all of you, let your desires for me be of a different
               class ; you may say with J. Montgomery, as I do for each of you, 'I dare not wish
               thee beauty, I dare not wish thee wealth, But only a contented mind, Peace,
               competent., and health.</p>
            <p>Fond friends to love thee dearly.</p>
            <p>And honest ones to chide, And faithful friends to succour thee</p>
            <p>Whatever may betide.' "</p>
            <p>The day passed very pleasantly with me."</p>
            <p>Her first visit to Niagara was thus described : — "3-8-1856. — We are now on board
               the steamer 'Arabian.' The handsome saloon is decorated with the most gorgeous
               painted glass. There are twenty-four windows three feet by two feet at each end, and
               about fifty or sixty smaller ones along each side, higher up. I can- not think how
               they can afford all this splendour at the price we pay, four dollars from Kingston to
               Toronto, a night's lodging, and two meals, in which ' the table groans with costly
               piles of food, And all is more than hospitably good.' No charge for children under
               twelve years. From Kingston to Belleville one-dollar-and- a-half; from Toronto to
               Niagara one dollar. . . . And we have really seen the world's wonder, Niagara !
               Everyone who sees it, is expected to say something about it, something great is
               generally looked for, but I never in my life felt so small, so insignificant, so
               feeble, as when I sat viewing the magnificent falls. 'What is man that thou art
               mindful of him?' again and again passed through my mind. My first feeling when the
               sight broke upon my view, was a slight shade of disappointment, that it was only a
               waterfall after all, and so exactly what my imagination had depicted from the
               pictures I had seen that I could scarcely believe I had never seen it before ; I did
               not feel as if I "was looking at something entirely new. This, my first sentimeint, I
               attribute to the incapacity of man's finite view, to take in, appreciate comprehend
               at a single glance, a spectacle so grand, so extensive, so magnificent, so glorious
               in resplendent beauty. The more we gazed, the more we admired; the longer we fixed
               our eyes upon the scene, the more new and varied beauties were presented to the
               astonished gaze. ' Transported with the view, I'm lost in wonder, love and
               praise.'"</p>
            <p>From Belleville 25-7 -56. — After mentioning a case of dispute between two parties,
               one of whom threatened to sue the other in order "to humble him a bit," E.L.W. wrote:
               "Oh, if we could each seek to humble ourselves, instead of each other, how much good
               might be done, how much suffering and misery saved. How much war and bloodshed might
               have been saved of late, if nations, as well as individuals, could be found to act
               upon this principle."</p>
            <p>Towards the end of the year, one of her sisters wrote from Belleville : "The last
               fortnight the ground has been covered with snow, and it has been an amusing sight to
               us to see the sleighs and cutters gliding about in all directions, their drivers
               snugly wrapped up in buffalo skins and other furs. There is a great deal more
               travelling here in winter than in summer, because the people from the country can
               then journey over their ' corduroy ' roads so much more easily than they can when
               there is no snow on the ground to fill up the interstices. The children have their
               small sleighs, in which they can draw each other along.</p>
            <p>"There is a good deal of freshness in the kind of life we lead here, and a good deal
               of freedom. It is pleasant, too, to know that there is abundance of food in the
               country, so that every man that will work can easily maintain his family. Our friend,
               S.Y., has recently engaged a poor man from England on his farm; he boards the man,
               allows him £30 a year, and a house, rent-free, on the farm for his wife and children.
               This is for the first year ; should he stay with him longer he will then receive
               higher wages as he will be more useful from having learned how to fell trees, saw
               wood, and other Canadian arts. The more I see of this country, the more convinced I
               am that -it is a good thing for the hard-working poor of England to emigrate. Here
               they can maintain their families in comfort with far less toil than is necessary in
               England to maintain them in poverty, and they can enjoy also the pleasure of
               independence. I have not seen a beggar since I came into the country (nearly six
               months). For those who are well off in England, this is not the country; the luxuries
               of life are much cheaper there than here.</p>
            <p>For the mechanic and labourer, who have difficulty in supporting themselves and
               families, emigration would prove a great blessing."</p>
            <p>E.L.W. to C.H.</p>
            <p>"One of the difficulties of travelling in this country is the mud-holes. One of the
               children rolled down a steep hill into a mud-hole, and came out completely plastered,
               as though she had been spread all over with brimstone and treacle. A mud-hole is a
               curiosity that the patriots in England never see. Those, I mean, who are too
               patriotic to leave their country. For your instruction I may state that a mud-hole is
               a hole full of mud, varying in depth from one foot to seven or eight. When the frost
               ' comes out ' of the earth, it leaves the ground very soft the depth of a foot or
               two, so soft that the horses' feet sink in, ditto the wheels. In some of the ruts the
               water sinks very deep; and stories are told of horses sinking and never being heard
               of again, in the poor roads through some of the marshes ! If you read Bunyan's
               description of the 'Slough of Despond,' you may form a pretty correct idea of a
               Canadian mud-hole in spring and ' fall,' only these are upon a much smaller scale. A
               sad accident occurred a few months ago. An English woman, probably not aware of the
               depth of our famous mud- holes, was riding along in a ' lumber wagon.' She ought to
               have held tight, but not doing so, she was thrown out by the violent jerk produced
               from the wheel entering a mud-hole and coming out again, and the vehicle went over
               her and killed her. Be sure you 'hold fast' when you come here and travel over our
               rough roads. This poor woman lost a son some time before. A boy, eleven years of age,
               had come from England with some neighbours, and on arriving at Belleville, took his
               seat in a lumber wagon to ride sixteen miles into the country to meet his mother, who
               was anxiously looking for him, and prevented by indisposition from meeting him at
               Belleville. When rather more than half way to Huntingdon, they were going over
               O'Brien's Bridge very fast. The boy full of animation, of life and spirits, perhaps
               standing up to admire the beauty of the scenery, I do not know, was jolted off, and
               thrown into the river and drowned- The stream is very broad there, and very
               beautiful, like a calm lake surrounded with woods. It is a lovely spot, but I never
               see it without thinking of that bright boy, in his joy and pleasure, so suddenly cut
               off, and of his mother's disappointment and sorrow- . . . I hope this will reach thee
               on thy birthday, with many more valuable epistles. On occasions like this I feel
               sadly at a loss what to say, or in what language to express my good wishes. The
               hackneyed phrase ' I wish you many happy returns ' is so w^orn out, I do not like to
               use it. After all, I do not know any more expressive language than the ancient Jewish
               mode of salutation, ' Peace be with thee ! ' Therefore let this be the language with
               which my spirit greets thine, ' Peace be with thee,' my sister, in the fullest sense
               of the word. . . . Since my last to you, I have been a good deal from home with our
               dear friend, Eliza Brewer, holding public meetings in different parts of this county,
               and visiting the families of Friends in this Monthly Meeting. It was a very favoured
               time to me, and I can truly say many opportunities we had were ' seasons of
               refreshing from the presence of the Lord.' I felt it a privilege to be dear E. B.'s
               companion in this service. I am just placed upon a very singular appointment by our
               Quarterly Meeting — to visit one of our Monthly Meetings, Leeds, 110 miles East of
               this place. There are not many Friends there. Two families, the most intelligent,
               wealthy and influential, have become Spiritualists : (the others seem to be following
               them) one, a medium, has commenced speaking in meeting, and preaches spiritual
               doctrines. So a committee of six men and four women are appointed to visit them, and
               give them ' such assistance as our place in the body and their state require.' I feel
               so very ignorant that I may truly say 'I know not what this new doctrine, whereof
               they speak, is!' Oh! I trust we may be guided, led about, and instructed in tliis
               matter, and preserved from doing any harm. Oh ! for the wisdom of the serpent, and
               the harmlessness of the dove!"</p>
            <p>The following letter was from her brother, who left England for Canada in 1856:
               17-1-1857. Since I last wrote to England, we have had some very severe weather,
               thermometer for three successive nights, 24°, 240, and 18° below zero. This was last
               week, and it so happened that we (Elizabeth and myself) started on a sleighing
               expedition on the preceding day, and were out the whole of the time. We went to
               attend the Quarterly Meeting near Kingston. Meetings here seem to be kept carefullj^
               clear of towns. This was held at Waterloo, about four miles from Kingston. We went
               about eleven miles (between five and eight p.m.) the first evening. I felt the cold
               very much, although defended by a massive top coat, with a thick cloak over it, and
               several wrappers in front. The small part of my face uncovered (nose, eyes, and
               brow), became so painful from cold that I had at last to throw my plaid completely
               over my head, with two thicknesses in front. My dear R., being in the back seat, felt
               it less, and E., who sat by me, bore it better than I did. The house we stopped at,
               quite a small wooden one, had several visitors besides ourselves. The sleeping
               accommodation was amusing. At one side of one room (there were three on the ground
               floor) were two beds, in the middle a settee. R. and I occupied one of the former,
               another Friend and his wife and child the other, E. and a lady companion the settee.
               The process adopted was this : the ladies retired first and located themselves, the
               gentlemen then following, and dis- covering by instinct, observation, or enquiry, to
               which bed to betake themselves. In the morning the reverse process took place. The
               following day was clear and bright, and we much enjoyed the forty miles dri^e,
               lasting from about nine till five, excepting an hour- and-a-half for dinner and
               warming ourselves, as well as resting the horses. The next two nights we lodged at a
               Friend's house, who very comfortably accommodated about thirty besides ourselves. He
               had built his house expressly for the entertainment of Friends, his former one (quite
               large enough for himself and family) having been too small for that purpose."</p>
            <p>"18-1-1857. Last night was, I think, the coldest we have had, and I will just mention
               a few of the phenomena. The windows were of course all frosted over, and in a
               different fashion to what you see in England. Here the frost-work, which is very
               beautiful, accumulates till it is ove7^ half-an-inch in thickness. The water in my
               sponging tray, in our bedroom, was about one-half of it changed to ice, and rattled
               curiously as 1 used it. The sponge was frozen stiff. The water splashed upon the
               floor, where there was no carpet, became ice at once. The extremities of my hair were
               frozen before I had used the comb and brush. The towel was stijffi a few minutes
               after being used. The front door was covered with frost inside, like the windows ' at
               home.' Dost thou understand this ex- pression? It is often used here in reference to
               the ' old country,' for which a very strong attachment is generally felt. I have just
               put into the stove a log, which has been lying close to it for four hours, there ivas
               snow on it, and a part of this yet remains in the form of ice. Of course the floor
               may have ice upon it quite near the stove. . . I was pumping to-day and sprinkled the
               handle, by which I had just carried the pail (wood to hold by), I tried at once to
               shake the drops off but they had become solid. I might multiply my illustrations, but
               wish now to add that we do not find the cold at all insupportable, unless when
               driving in an open conveyance, or when, on very rare occasions, the extreme frost is
               accompanied by wind. The air is clear and dry, and our clothing is adapted to the
               weather, To me, the winter seems quite a pleasant season, and I am only apprehensive
               of the heat of summer, which I think we have scarcely yet experienced."</p>
            <p>After two or three years in business at Belleville, E. L. W. wrote — " I think of
               retiring at the end of this year. I shall have but a small income, but a little will
               do for dear C. and me in this country, where everything is so cheap that is necessary
               to live upon. We shall have a neat little stone cottage, with a verandah, rent free,
               an acre of land of our own, and as much fire-wood as we can burn, for many years to
               come. Our own fowls will supply us with eggs, and our wants will be few. You will
               perhaps wonder at my readiness to retire from a remunerative business so soon, and
               with so small an income. My chief reason is, that I feel I have a call for other work
               than shop-keeping, and that a good soldier should not be • too much entangled with
               the things of this life.' I want to hold myself at liberty for that work, in
               attending to which I find true peace of mind."</p>

         </div>
         <div type="chapter">
            <p>HE removed to the United States on her marriage</p>
            <p>K_ to John T. Comstock, of Rollin, Michigan, in 1858. Her previous life had been
               marked by much energetic labour in the varied avocations which had fallen to her lot,
               and here, on what was then regarded as a Western farm, she found scope in various
               ways for the exercise of those natural talents, trained and mellowed by her life's
               experience, which now began to be more con- spicuously employed for the good of those
               around her.</p>
            <p>Her friends soon found that she had received a valuable gift in the ministry of the
               Word, and she was made very helpful in building up the small meeting which at that
               time assembled in Rollin.</p>
            <p>Her labours were not long confined to that locality. She visited first the meetings
               of Friends in her own Yearly Meeting, and, later on, paid a general visit to many of
               the prisons, asylums, and poorhouses in the States, her ministrations proving
               exceedingly useful and comforting to the objects of her loving concern. In several
               instances she was the means of encouraging the commencement of a new course of life,
               which led in after years to the re-instatement of the individuals in a position
               commanding the love and esteem of their fellow-citizens.</p>
            <p>In common with many other members of the Society of Friends at this time, she felt a
               deep interest in the condition of the coloured population, and was able to aid, in
               some cases, the escape of fugitives to the land of freedom.</p>
            <p>The following is her own description of some of these cases : —</p>
            <p>"After the passing of the wicked Fugitive Slave Law, which made it a penal offence to
               shelter an escaped slave, many fugitives fled northAvard through Michigan into
               Canada. Among these, the first who largely called forth my sympathy by seeking refuge
               in our house, in 1858, was Lucy, a tall, handsome quad- roon, bearing in her arms a
               child of seven or eight months.</p>
            <p>"We did what we could to hide her away for awhile, and then help her off on the
               Underground Railwaj^ towards Canada. She was placed in the charge of a well-known
               abolitionist, to take her on the last stage towards lake Erie. Just as she was
               leaving the station at Sandusky, she saw a placard, describing in large letters
               herself and her baby, and offering 1,200 dollars reward for her arrest. In great
               terror, she pointed it out to the conductor, who took her back, and hid her in the
               baggage-car, saying he expected soon to run the train into Detroit, and could perhaps
               get her across the river there. On landing in Detroit, the same difficulty presented,
               a similar placard being posted there. Again poor Lucy took refuge in the baggage-car,
               while the kind-hearted conductor undertook to go into the city and see a gentleman,
               who was an earnest abolitionist. He brought his carriage in the dusk of the evening,
               and took her home to his house. He and his wife carefully secreted her for several
               days, while they endeavoured to devise means for transporting her across the river —
               in vain. In every direction the notice of the large rew^ard offered, met their eye.
               At length, as a last resort, the lady proposed to Lucy the following plan; that she
               and her husband should be travelling, Lucy's baby in her arms, dressed up like her
               own, and Lucy with her ringlets cut off, disguised as a porter, should carry the
               trunk, and thus go on board the steamer. To this plan, Lucy made great objection.
               First, she was unwilling to lose her ringlets, and secondly, to put on men's clothes;
               but her objections were overruled by the gentleman and lady, who told her this was
               her only chance of escape. She was so tall, and the description of her person and
               baby so accurate that she could be easily identified, unless thoroughly disguised.
               They equipped accordingly, the gentleman and lady in their carriage went down just
               before the starting of the boat, the lady had the baby in her arms, dressed just like
               her own, and closely veiled; the pretended porter carried the box before them up the
               gangway. Lucy, as she walked on to the boat, passed within a stone's throw of her
               master, who was watching intently every passenger who went on board. No sooner had
               the steam-boat moved from the wharf, than Lucy throwing aside her disguise, her
               turban on her head, her baby in her arms, stood on deck, under the light of the lamp,
               and waved an eternal farewell to her master.</p>
            <p>"He frantically called out for the captain to stop, shouting aloud that he would give
               him 1,000 dollars, if he would put back for one quarter of an hour. The captain,
               comprehending the whole situation, calmly replied 'Don't be excited my dear sir,
               don't be excited, there will be another boat soon.' It would have taken more than
               1,000 dollars to bribe that liberty- loving captain to return the poor fugitive to
               her master. Within half an hour, Lucy set foot upon the Canadian soil, which she had
               so long been seeking and travelling toward. The first thing she did on reaching land,
               was to prostrate herself upon the earth, kiss the ground, and pray God to bless Queen
               Victoria and all her people for providing a refuge for the oppressed.</p>
            <p>"Three years had passed away, when Lucy again presented herself at our dwelling,
               during which time she had not only provided for herself and little girl by her
               industry in laundry work and millinery, but had laid by 375 dollars, with which to
               purchase her husband's freedom. We exerted ourselves to assist her in this object,
               and found that her husband could be purchased for 600 dollars (1,200 had been asked
               for her — see the relative value of men and women at this time in the United States).
               I took her with me to meeting on Sunday, and at its close introduced her to the
               congregation, stated the circumstances, and made an urgent appeal for help. An aged
               and very conservative Friend arose, and objected to money transactions being entered
               into on the Sabbath, and in a meeting-house. As he took his seat, my sister- in-law,
               Rachel S. Beal, stood up, and said ' If any man among you have an ox or an ass fallen
               into a pit on the Sabbath day, will he not straightway release him? ' These few
               words, spoken with the quiet dignity of a woman whose voice was rarely heard there,
               produced an effect almost magical. The result was, a good collection was taken up;
               this was followed by similar efforts in surrounding neighbourhoods, and other
               meetings, and the desired sum was soon made up, with the addition of sufficient money
               to pay her husband's travelling expenses to Canada, where they were soon comfortably
               settled with their little daughter.</p>
            <p>"Another thrilling incident connected with the escape of a fugitive slave I will here
               relate. The poor fellow had run away from the south, travelled many hundred miles by
               night, hiding away during the day, when, foot-sore, weary, and exhausted, he rushed
               into the barnyard of a Friend in Ohio, who was working with straw and pitchfork among
               his cattle. In distress and terror, poor Sam quickly made known his situation to the
               Friend, who told him to lie down on the straw and he would cover him up. He bade him
               not to fear, saying he had had many a score of fugitives in his hands, and not one
               had been recaptured. The pursuers were close behind and quickly made their
               appearance. They accosted the Friend, who was apparently very busy at his work,
               demanding what had become of their 'nigger,' whom they had seen come into his
               barnyard.</p>

            <p>"A sudden deafness semed to have seized the farmer, who apparently heard none of
               their queries. Coming closer to him, and shouting much louder, he looked up at them,
               and with his hand behind his ear, asked, ' Lost a cow, did you say? ' In very loud
               tones they replied, ' No, a nigger, and we saw him come through your gateway.' With
               his hand still up to help his hearing, ' Did she have a white spot on her forehead,
               Alderney breed?' 'No, you old fool,' was the rejoinder, and with many rough words and
               much profanity, they tried to make him comprehend they were going to search his house
               and buildings for their lost property, who they felt sure was concealed there. He
               said he had not seen or heard any negro go into his house, though he had been working
               there all the afternoon. With sundry uncomplimentary epithets,, they intimated that
               he was such a dull, stupid old fellow, that a whole regiment of soldiers might have
               gone in without his seeing or hearing them. He replied that he did not think any one
               could have gone in without his seeing them, but that an honest man need not be afraid
               of having his house searched,, and they might search as much as they liked,, but he
               felt sure they would not find him there. They went in and searched every nook and
               corner from garret to cellar, looking into every room, closet, clothes' press,
               between beds and mattresses, and even into the old Dutch clock-case, then thoroughly
               examined the- barns, stables, and other out-buildings. * Pity you didn't take the
               word of an honest man,' said the Friend,, as they Avere departing, ' I told you he
               wasn't there.'</p>

            <p>"Near the gate they saw a boy, one of the farmer's sons, and asked him if he had seen
               the negro, describing his appearance. The youth, like most Friends' children in those
               parts, was not disposed to help a slave-catcher, and replied that he did see a man,
               looking something like that, going up yon hill a mile away an hour ago. He could not
               see his face, and did not know w^hether he was black or white. The two men started in
               pursuit in the direction indicated, and as soon as they were quite out of sight and
               hearing, Jabez Brown called to Sam to get up, and come into the house for the
               greatly-needed refreshment, rest, and change of apparel. With cordial greeting and
               kindly words he cheered the poor fellow by saying, * Now, Sam, my house will be the
               safest place for thee for a month to come; thou art quite welcome and need not be at
               all afraid, for I can outwit all the slave-hunters who may come, and they cannot look
               a second time in the same place — it is against the law.' Sam staid there quietly for
               five or six weeks, and was then passed on by the Underground Railway, and arrived
               safely in Canada, adding to the 15,000 already there, fugitive slaves, or the
               descendants of such, as healthy, honest, sober and industrious a people as either
               race can present. . .</p>
            <p>"My next narrative shall be of a beautiful octoroon, who had been a great favourite
               with her mistress. Upon the death of the latter, she was sold at auction, and became
               the property of a young profligate from the far south, who paid 1,800 dollars for
               her. She was in exceeding distress at the prospect before her, knowing she was
               destined to be ruined body and soul. She endeavoured to restrain her tears, and hide
               her feelings from her new owner, lest he should place her in chains. He came and
               talked with her, speaking smooth words and making fair promises. He told her of his
               elegant carriage and horses, of his magnificent home and l3eautiful gardens, and
               promised that she should be the mistress of his house. She manifested no repugnance,
               but appeared pleased. In the night she made her escape, travelled night after night,
               hiding away all day, until she reached Ohio. To her great distress, she found she was
               pursued by two horsemen, of whom now and then she caught sight in the distance. In
               the afternoon of the third day after she made her escape, with her feet bleeding, and
               dress soiled and torn, she rushed into a barn, where a plainly dressed Friend was
               busy at work. She hurriedly told of her distress, and the pursuers were close behind.
               ' Don't be alarmed, my child,' he said, as he led her through the barn and a small
               door at the back, 'but go to James Green at that house,' designating one near by, '
               and tell him that I say he must take thee on immediately, without any delay, by the
               "Underground Railway, and I will detain the pursuers here, until thou art a
               considerable distance on thy way to Canada — they will never catch thee.' So saying,
               he went out again by the large barn doors, and had only just time to fasten them
               securely, and nail up three or four boards across them, when the slave-catchers rode
               up, and demanded the slave whom they had seen enter there. As the Friend went on
               steadily with his work, paying very little attention to them, they dismounted,
               hitched their horses to the fence, and began trying to get the door open. One of them
               caught up an axe that was lying near, and was about to break it open, when the
               Friend, laying his hand upon his arm, said to him quietly, ;Young man, thou art now
               in a free state; we have laws in Ohio, and it is a penitentiary offence to break open
               another man's premises. I assure thee I have none of thy property there, but if thou
               wilt not take the word of an honest man and art determined to search my barn, thou
               must do it legally. Thou wilt have to bring a constable and a warrant." The two men
               conferred together a few minutes, and after roundly abusing him, agreed that one
               should stay there, and watch that the girl did not make her escape, while the other
               went in quest of a constable and w^arrant. This proved no easy work, for while they
               had been talking to the farmer, the boys had quietly unhitched the horses, which were
               now seen wandering at some distance. After awhile they were caught, and another
               difficulty arose in finding their way to a constable, in a strange country, where no
               one seemed disposed to aid them, or to give reliable information as to the way. Just
               as the young man was departing, the Friend called out to him, that he might as well
               bring a carpenter too, for, having a newly-painted barn, the work must be done
               skilfullj', the nails drawn carefully; he would expect to recover damages if anything
               was injured. Two or three hours elapsed before his return, bringing the constable,
               warrant, and carpenter, during which time his companion never once lost sight of the
               barn, watching closely that the girl should not make her escape. The Friend was still
               nailing up his boards, as if desirous of making the place very secure, but in reality
               to gain time. As the carpenter was beginning to draw the nails, the Friend enquired
               of him who was going to pay him for his work, and who would pay the damage if the
               newly-painted barn was injured. This occasioned some further delay, as the carpenter
               stipulated he should not be responsible for damages, and should be w^ell paid by his
               employers.</p>
            <p>"At length, as the sun went down, the nails were drawn, barn-doors thrown open, the
               two young southerners rushed in to seize their prey, and behold the barn was empty !
               A volley of oaths and curses succeeded, which did not in the least rufiQe the temper
               or disturb the equanimity of the good man. He went on quietly with his work until the
               strife of tongues had ceased, and then courteously invited the young strangers to
               partake of the hospitalities of his house for the night, reminding them that there
               was no hotel within several miles, and that their horses would be jaded and w^eary.
               Having no alternative, they very reluctantly accepted his invitation, resolved that
               early on the morrow they w^ould resume the search for their lost property. Their host
               took the opportunity that evening to hold some converse with them on the evils of
               slavery, but did not succeed in converting them into abolitionists. One young man
               complained that his case was very hard, having paid out 1,800 dollars, only a few
               days before, for the poor slave, to which the Friend replied it was a hard case, but
               would have been a far harder one for her, had he succeeded in capturing her. The best
               the house afforded was set before the guests, and an excellent lodgment provided for
               both them and their horses.</p>
            <p>"On the following morning the family deviated from their usual practice of
               breakfasting at six o'clock, and sat down to table at nine with becoming delibera-
               tion. After breakfast, the boys were an unusually long time in preparing the horses,
               and when at length they were ready to depart, their host gave them a few words of
               parting admonition. He told them it would be useless to pursue or search longer for
               the girl, that she had gone on by the Underground Railway, and was now nearing
               Canada, and it would be impossible for them to catch her. He advised them to return
               home, and never to come to Ohio on similar business again, but if any other business
               should call them this way, he extended to them a cordial invitation to seek rest and
               shelter beneath his roof; his house was ever open to those who needed it of either
               race I saw</p>
            <p>the girl some months after in Canada, and heard the account from her own lips, as
               well as from the Friend who had with so much ingenuity saved her. She was a skilful
               milliner and dressmaker, and earned a com- fortable livelihood by her needle."</p>

            <p>HE following letter was addressed to her young- nephews and nieces in Canada : —</p>
            <p>"8mo. 7th, '59. I have just returned from a most delightful day's ramble. I
               accompanied a party to a school examination and picnic in the woods, eight miles from
               here. J. and H. H. took me. J. H. is the Friend who was convinced by reading G. P.
               R.'s tracts on his way out from England twenty-eight years ago. His son J. is C.'s
               friend, his daughter R. teaches our district school. Of course C. and J. were of the
               party. I wish all of you could have been with us, you would have very much enjoyed
               it. "We were a large party ourselves. H. H., who is a most liberal house- keeper,
               provided an elegant repast, which w^as conveyed with us in baskets. We reached the
               encampment about 9.30 a.m. Many thousands were there before us. As soon as we entered
               the woods the sound of music attracted us to the spot. A hand from Hudson had been
               engaged for the purpose, composed of many of the wealthiest tradesmen there. It was a
               beautiful sight our eyes beheld when we ascended some rising ground, mounted a log,
               and looked dowm upon a gentle slope, w^here were seated about a thousand
               children.</p>

            <p>looking as happy as children can look in this world. The girls were nearly all
               dressed in white with a blue sash, and a wreath of flowers round their heads. The
               melody of their young voices singing so sweetly was a sound that I could not help
               being enchanted by, Quaker as I am. There was a pleasant breeze stirring the trees
               and making us feel cool, while the dense woods shaded us from the scorching beams of
               the sun. All the schools of the township were assembled to- gether, all the teachers
               of course, and the directors; most of the parents of the children, and multitudes of
               visitors from surrounding townships. There was something so imposing in the whole
               appearance, that I felt fairly transported to Utopia or Paradise by a first glance.
               How I wished you were all there ! R., thou w^ould'st have been delighted. The little
               ones would have been beside themselves with glee. F. would have joined multitudes of
               little boys that mounted the trees and took a bird's eye view of the whole. The trees
               looked alive with little boys, not the schools to be examined, but the little
               visitors from other schools. The examination was for the thirteen schools in
               Wheatland township, not Rollin. The thirteen schools had their different badges,
               banners, and devices, their wreaths and garlands, &amp;c. The whole assembly that
               greeted our delighted eyes I wish I could daguerreo- type for you. Above and around
               were our majestic forest trees, rich in foliage, dotted with little boys, silent
               spectators of the scene. Below on an area, between and amongst the trees, 1,000
               children — 500 boys, 500 girls — their bright eyes and happy faces radiant with
               delight and eager with expectation. On a raised platform a committee o gentlemen, who
               took the management, with some professors from Hillsdale College, on the right hand
               raised seats for lady visitors, opposite to them the same for the band, while in the
               background were throngs of people eager to hear and see. As far as the eye could
               reach, right and left, in the front and rear, were more coming; more, and more, and
               more poured in, until we left off wondering where they would find seats, to wonder
               where they came from. While looking hither and thither, lo, a new wonder arose on my
               astonished gaze — F. M. W., listen. Over there, a great way off, were people building
               tables. They had props and sticks, and poles and stumps, and all were put to some use
               speedily, and soon a table was spread in the wilderness — such a table — in the form
               of a crescent or new moon. A. confidently affirmed it to be half a mile long, some
               one else disputed the fact, and was persuaded it was only a third of a mile, while J.
               and C. after walking round it, were loud in their assurances that it was a full mile.
               And these tables were not empty. Do W. and D. and L. want to know what was on them ?
               Very well, I will tell you, and you can tell Lina. First, clean, white tablecloths,
               and then bread, cheese, butter, boiled fowl, roast fowl, chicken pie, ham, veal,
               roast sucking pig, all kinds of cold meat, maple molasses, maple sugar formed into
               hearts and eggs, and boys and girls, and dogs and cats, and hens and chicks. Candies
               of every conceivable shape and size, red candies, green candies, blue, yellow, pink,
               white and orange coloured candies. Pies, cakes, tarts, turnovers, jellies, preserves,
               pickles, puddings, of all kinds and sizes, baked and boiled. Fruits of all sorts that
               are in season, apples, pears, oranges, nuts, raisins, dates. Custards, blancmange,
               and to crown all, yyramids of sugar or iced cakes, not so large as the pyramids of
               Egypt, F., but as large as a boy like thee could carry. Some like churches, some like
               chapels, some to imitate the pagodas of the East, some like a full moon, some like a
               crescent, some like a lighthouse. I thought of all of you, dear children, and how
               pleasant it would have been if you could have come and joined with C. and J. and
               walked round the tables, and each have had your choice of one thing, something you
               could carry away with you, and share with papa and mamma at home. Well, when we had
               had a good look at the tables, the music and singing attracted us again to the
               schools. There was not much of an examination. It might more properly be called an
               exhibition. The children recited, read, and sang. Some of the boys recited remarkably
               well — some young orators are training there The morning exercises over, they walked
               in procession to dinner, two and two, and looked very pretty. The band meantime
               played a lively tune. In the afternoon we had a rich treat, the best lecture on
               education that I ever heard, by an eloquent man. Professor Dunn, from Hillsdale
               College, about twenty miles north of this place. It was delivered from the platform
               from which they had examined the schools, to more than a thousand persons. He
               lectured about an hour. This picnic, or feast, or whatever v.-e may call it, differed
               from any dinner or tr^at of the kin l in England, in two or three important
               particulars. The majestic trees, the forest depths, the rustic seats, many of them
               formed for the occasion by trees felled on purpose; the free untrammelle'I
               intercourse of all classes, ranks, and denominations. The treat was not given by the
               rich to the poor, but all contributed as they were inclined. Every school supplied
               its own table, every pupil contributed some provisions. The band, the professor, the
               trustees and directors, r^rceived no pay. but one of the splendid pyramidal iced
               cakes presented publicly at the close of the lecture. Each district presentC'l a
               cake. The band, consisting of twelve gentlemen, received six. Two newspaper editors
               were there, who were each presented with a cake. Xo doubt we shall see the fruits
               thereof in the next week's papers. If I see them, and find any very interesting
               account, I will send you them."</p>
            <p>E.L.C. to C.H.</p>
            <p>"One day last summer I was seated writing when I heard two men in conversation
               outside. 'Go in and ask her,' said one. 'I am afraid she won't come,' was the reply.
               'You must shake hands and talk Quaker. and then she will,' said the first speaker,
               and forthwith the man came in, a rough-looking country farmer, with long, shaggy
               beard, and commenced trying his skill at talking Quaker with offering his rough, hard
               hand to shake hands, and saying ' I have come to ask thou if ijouV.l come and preach
               a funeral sermon for Mrs. I.' I was so amused I could not frame an answer suitable to
               the solemnity of the subject. The man proceeded, finding I did not answer, * You
               preached the funeral sermon for the old man last year, and the people want you to
               come again. I gave out notice that you were coming, and we shall have a large funeral
               and a full house.' As soon as I could regain my com- posure, I replied by enquiring
               about the deceased. I found this was one of a large family of sons that she had left
               behind. She died in her ninety-fourth year. After a little conversation with the man,
               he told me he had other business to do in town and would call again in an hour or
               two. Upon his return, having well considered the matter, I told him that I must
               decline going with him. He wished to know my reasons. I explained a little, Friends'
               views of the Gospel ministry, and that I did not feel called to go. ' I gave you the
               first call,' he said, ' I have not asked anj^one else.' I tried to make him
               understand what I meant by a call, and told him that I could not go and preach just
               when I wished or when I was invited, and said, I suppose if I go and have nothing to
               say you will be disappointed.' * Yes, very much indeed,' he answered, 'for some
               people are coming a great ivaijs to hear you.' After vainly urging the point, he went
               away and got a Methodist preacher to go with him. For several days after this, every
               now and then someone would ask me why I did not go and preach Mrs. I's funeral
               sermon, telling me that public notice had been given out that I was going to do
               so."</p>
            <p>Rollin, 8-2-l86O. "Day by day, I am reproved by the sight of a silent memento of
               thee, an unanswered letter in my desk. I do sensibly feel and acknowledge that I am
               guilty of neglecting thee and dear L., my relatives at Kettering our dear Aunts, and
               our Australian kindred. But how to remedy the evil, is beyond my wisdom and skill to-
               say. Xo sooner do I get a day free from household duties, than I take my desk and
               portfolio, and seat myself with the resolution to write to one of my far distant
               relatives. "^ell, thus seated and ready, it becomes a question to which shall I write
               first — my long list of letters labelled ' unanswered,' is apijcdling — I quickly
               decide, and in a sort of desperation » commence three or four, resolved thus to
               secare^ and be certain of writing to these; I am in a letter-writing mood, and feel
               that I can accomplish wonders, but alas I alas I before the first page is completed,
               visitors number one, two, three, four, come pouring in, trying my patience to the
               utmost, and my diligence too. My writing has to be set aside, and the pies, cakes,
               custards,, sauces, &amp;c., &amp;c., prepared for my unwelcome and untimely guests. '
               Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon,' that the wife of a
               Michigan farmer has used so inhospitable an expression. I should lose caste and
               character rapidly, if suspected of such feelings. Hospitality, indiscriminate, open-
               handed hospitality without partiality, is a cardinal virtue in this country, the
               contrary-, a capital offence. It is nothing but the want of time that prevents my
               writing two or three articles against so much visiting, and sending them to some of
               our popular newspapers. Dear C, canst not thou write something to the point and send
               me. Oh, if thou would, I should be so thankful, and beg of S. to do the same, and
               dear L. too. They would do good. Our newspapers are read at all the farm-houses and
               have weight. Here comes a pedlar, visitor No. 1. A gentlemanly, foreign looking young
               man, with a satchel and tin box slung over his shoulder with a leathern strap. . . .
               10-2mo. That young pedlar is a Polish Jew, with the flashing black eye, dark cast of
               countenance, and strongly marked features ot his fatherland and his peculiar people.
               He is selling jewellery, brooches, rings, pins, lockets, and many other * Babylonish
               vanities.' He Avanted supper, lodging, breakfast, &amp;c. — was accom- modated
               cheerfully with all — he offered to pay — we, of course, declined receiving anything.
               A very intelligent young man, only one year from Poland, speaks English tolerably,
               and French fluently. John has talked with him most earnestly on the New Testament,
               commending it to his serious, prayerful reading. He received it well. There is after
               all some jjleasure in receiving such guests, and I hope a blessing in store. Well,
               here comes another, No. 2, a tall stalwart athletic frame, one of Afric's sable sons.
               At the sight of one of these oppressed people, our hearts, our hands, our houses, our
               purses, are freely opened. Would that the kindness, the sympathy, the liberality
               shown by the abolitionists towards the fugitives who cross their path, could wash
               away some of the dark stains, blotting the records of this nation, could lessen the
               cruel wrongs heaped upon their race by ours. C, dear, tell me in thy next what is the
               origin, what the cause of colour in the Africans. Give me S.'s opinion, and John and
               Joseph Pease's, if you can get it. It is an interesting question here, and the
               occasion of much discussion. While J. is entertaining and conversing with our black
               brother, I will give thee a little sketch of his graphic and tragic history. His
               father was kidnapped in Africa, and endured all the horrors of crossing the Atlantic
               in a slave ship. Many died on the passage, fever and pestilence raged amongst them,
               produced by the want of fresh air in the hold of the ship, w^here they were too
               closely packed. This poor fellow has had a dreadful time as a slave in Virginia, and,
               at length, goaded by his sufferings, and impelled by a thirst for liberty, he fled.
               Numberless difficulties and dangers^ met him by the way and . . . . knock at the
               door, visitors Xos. 3, 4, 5, 6. Four men and four horses want supper, lodging,
               breakfast, &amp;c. No acquaintance. Dirty, rough-looking fellows, going about with a
               thrashing machine. Farewell to my writing for to-night and to-morrows There will be
               cooking to do, beds to prepare, &amp;c., then bedding to wash. Truly, this is a weary
               world — how delightful if ever favoured to reach that land of rest and peace, where
               nothing unclean shall enter. Where ' there remaineth a rest for the people of
               God.'"</p>
            <p>"12th 2mo. A quiet day alone with my dear hus- band. I believe it is almost the first
               since our marriage. He is now^ gone out to milk, &amp;c., and I propose to spend a
               quiet hour writing to tliee. I have many thin^^fs to say, but fear I may not have
               time for all. First, thank thee, dear C, for thy last welcome letter; it was very
               inter- esting. How I should like to see my dear little nephew and niece. . . . F.'s
               little lectures and instructions must be beautiful to listen to. Do they ever quarrel
               ? Does F. ever manifest any disposition to teaze or tyrannize over his little sister
               ? Has M.C. any faults? Does she manifest enough of human nature to prove herself a
               true child of Adam's fallen race? They both come of a pretty good stock, so I hope
               they are not very faulty ! C. is a great comfort to me. She is a strange combination
               of good and evil. She has very quick sympathies, and is easily moved to tears by
               seeing anyone or anything suffering. She shed many tears over Martin's'^ broken leg,
               and devoted many an hour of her playtime reading to him, to take his attention, or
               drive away his pain. ' That little angel ! ' he said one day, ' I do believe she was
               made to comfort others ! ' When I have a bad headache or anything the matter with me,
               she is a tender, gentle little nurse. When we have any children visiting here, she is
               quite in her element, the most boisterous and unruly will submit to her control, the
               most fretful and irritable will be soothed by her. Most of our circle here think her
               decidedly the best hand at amusing and taking care of children that they have ever
               known. She does seem to have a peculiar gift that way. . . . Here comes my dearest
               J., but I see we are not to have a quiet evening alone, for he is bringing with him
               visitor No. 7, a somewhat singular looking man with the costume of the South, strong
               built, dark complexion, fierce-looking A slave-driver ! Well, we have all sorts. All
               classes are at home here, all claim fellowship with us, and I suppose all should have
               our sympathy. Poor man, he has lost his right arm. That arm that has often swung the
               cat-o'-nine-tails, and wielded the whip around the shrinking form of the poor slave,
               is gone for ever — it shall torture suffering- humanity no more. It w^as torn off by
               the machinery of a ' cotton-gin,' as he was driving the poor slaves. On the whole, he
               seems a pleasant man in conversation. He does not think slavery lurong, he believes a
               slave is just as much the property of his master, as his horse or sheep is. He has
               read ' Uncle Tom's Cabin,' and does not like it. Thinks the slaves are a sort of
               middle class between men and beasts, and that they are generally well treated, that a
               man usually takes as much care of his negroes as of his cattle, and that, if set
               free, they could not provide for themselves, &amp;c., &amp;c. He has left the
               plantations, and is going home to his relatives in the north of this state. Farewell
               for to-night."</p>
            <p>"13th 2mo. Our Monthly Meeting is over; we have had quite a large company of Friends.
               Dr. E., and family, from Ohio; an intelligent man, very abstemious, one who
               disapproves of the superfluous loading of our tables, and thinks that *most of the
               inhabitants of this land eat twice as much as is good for them ! ' An aged couple who
               have come ten miles to meeting, seventy-five and seventy-eight years of age. A Friend
               and wife, and five children, the youngest five weeks old; the mother, a pleasant
               woman, seems as much at ease as though she had no children to see to, while C. goes
               away with the four others and two belonging to someone else, who willingly part with
               them for awhile. C. seemed quite in her element with them. 4th S mo. My letter does
               not progress very fast. Other calls upon my time besides visitors have claimed my
               attention since I last laid down my pen. We have had three funerals at our
               meeting-house, and four at the other meeting-house a few miles from here. There has
               been a great deal of sickness and death around us of late. Six times I have been sent
               for to visit the sick and dying. One case was a peculiarly trying one. A young man,
               recently disowned for disorderly conduct by this Monthly Meeting, who had joined
               himself to a gang of unprofitable associates, a hunting set, had been out one night
               with them, stayed in the woods all night, came home with a bad cold, neglected it,
               inflam- mation on the lungs and bronchitis followed. A week after I was sent for; the
               messenger was very urgent, told me that Charles was in great distress of mind, that
               he was afraid to die, and the doctors had given him up. Of course I answered the
               call. I cannot describe that dying scene : the poor young man struggling with the
               King of Terrors, and frantically pleading for life, for time to prepare to die. Then
               wandering in delirium and shrinking from the grasp of death. It was a fearful sight.
               ' By many a deathbed I have been, And many a sinner's parting seen, But never aught
               like this I ' He struggled, he trembled, he wrestled, he gasped, he groaned. In his
               lucid intervals he entreated me to pray for him. Three days of great bodily anguish
               and mental agony succeeded, then a little season of tranquillity, a faint glimmer of
               hope, and then the struggle was ended, and the spirit left the suffering tabernacle.
               ' He is gone, the last day shall tell where ! ' Though a young man, he has left a
               young widow and three small children. Dost thou know it is not an unfrequent thing
               here for me to be sent for by those not Friends to pray with the sick and dying, and
               to preach a ' funeral sermon ' . . . . our ministers and elders encourage me to go
               and respond to such calls. On one occasion lately a poor old man wrs dying with a
               cancer, and urgently requested me to attend his funeral. After his death his widow
               and sons invited me ' to preach his funeral sermon.' I ex- plained our views to them
               on the Ministry, after which we heard they had engaged a Methodist minister to come
               and preach if I did not Friends here lend their meeting-houses freely to others, and
               use theirs as freely My health is not so good as it was two years ago, our
               oppressively hot summer weather does not suit me, it enfeebles me. During the winter
               I have been much better than in the summer. But I had a strange attack a month ago —
               all of a sudden a dizzy feeling came over me. I could not stand, and should have
               fallen had it not been for M. A., who was near at hand, and supported me. My head was
               in an unusual heat, my hands and feet cold. They got me to bed, with hot bricks to my
               feet, and in two or three hours I was quite well again, and have had no return of it
               since, but my dear husband seems constantly- anxious and uneasy about me. He is so
               afraid of apoplexy or something of that kind. He is exceedingly tender, attentive,
               and kind to me. If he should be taken away from me I don't know what I should do. We
               have had many pleasant rides together this winter, going to 'visit the fatherless and
               widows in their affliction,' the sick and dying in their suffering. . . . I have been
               learning to make soap and candles, and am becoming quite au fait at farmhouse
               work."</p>
            <p>"5th 3mo. We have had a great many more visitors, but time would fail me to tell of
               William, of Samuel, of Joseph, of Welcome, of Pearce, of Ira, of Peleg, of Addison,
               of Martha, of Charity, of Hiram also, and of the pedlars who, through their love of
               visiting, subdued and surmounted all difficulties and dangers, to tarry for awhile
               under our roof. I have other things to speak of, and the time is far spent. M.A. has
               given up her school, having found these sturdy young republicans somewhat
               insubordinate. They have studied the Declaration of Independence too much to submit
               to petticoat government so well as the loyal and liege subjects of our Queen do. They
               remind me of an educational meeting I attended in New York. About fifty persons
               spoke, and expressed about as many different opinions. One said, ' It is high time to
               establish a Yearly Meeting School, our young people are becoming so ungovernable. It
               is not now as it was fifty years ago; when I was a boy there was some government in
               families.' Another Friend responded to the above with, ' I do not at all agree with
               the last speaker, but think there is as much government in families now as ever there
               w^as, but the difference is just this, fifty years ago the old folks used to govern,
               and now the children do.' Such is life in the ' Great Eepublic ! ' . . . M.A. and I
               have just returned from a delightful stroll in the w^oods. It is a bright and
               beautiful spring day. How delightful it would have been if you could have come too !
               How thy little treasures would enjoy a ramble in our magnificent forests ! How do J.
               and his wife like England after their free life in the woods? Do they settle down and
               feel comfortable? The Friends here are liberal and tolerant in their views to all '
               orthodox ' bodies of Christians, but they cannot endure Spiritualists, Univer-
               salists, and Unitarians. They dread and shun these as they would serpents and
               venomous snakes."</p>
            <p>E.L.C. to L.R. and C.H.</p>
            <p>Rollin, 30-9-1860. "Just able to sit up, recovering from an attack of 'chill fever,'
               I take the pen to have a little talk with thee, dear L., and to tell thee how often I
               have thought of thee of late, and how I have longed to sec thee, and to feel thy cool
               soft hand upon my burning brow. I have been ill of a complaint here designated '
               chill fever,' to which settlers in a new country are peculiarly liable. There is
               scarcely a house in this neighbourhood without an inmate who is suffering from it
               now, or has done so within a year. It comes on with a chill, a sinking low sensation,
               and as though cold water was trickling down the back and through the shivering limbs.
               This is succeeded by an unconi- fortable degree of heat, gradually rising to a
               parching fever, accompanied by mental aberration; the climax of heat subsides to a
               sort of physical zero in about twelve hours, and back again in twelve more, perform-
               ing a cycle in twenty-four hours. ... I was interrupted in writing the foregoing by
               my dear husband, who insisted on my laying down pen and paper, and restingy "10th mo.
               3rd. John came in the other day, and weak and feeble as I felt, I could not help
               laughing outright at what he said. I felt a little returning appetite, and asked him
               to kill a chicken, that I might have a little chicken broth. He protested against it,
               told me I was not nearly well enough, and he feared it would throw me into a fever.
               However he added, he would go and get me (and would cook it himself) a piece of fat
               pork out of the pork barrel. The bare mention of it was enough for me. He assured me
               I should ' eat it with a great relish,' that ' everybody does,' that ' there was not
               the least danger of it hurting me. People take it when they are very low, almost
               dead, and eat it eagerly, and it is astonishing how soon it raises them up after the
               fever leaves them.' Well, I awaited its arrival with some anxiety, quite sure in my
               own mind that it would make me sick. But John was very urgent and quite irresistible,
               so I tried to take it, and strange to say after the first mouthful, all nausea and
               repulsive feeling vanished, and I did eat it with a relish, quite a thick slice of
               fat pork, and some bread soaked in the fat, and cooked and smoked almost black, while
               held over the top of our wood fire!!"</p>
            <p>"10th mo., 6th. I do not get on very fast with my letter, I find so many things to
               do. I am recruiting my strength pretty well, and shall not be much the worse for the
               attack by and by, I hope. A. happened to be here with her husband on a visit, when I
               was taken ill, she stayed a week after my attack came on, so I had her kind care. M.
               A. was away at first, but she came home directly on hearing that I was not well, and
               she stayed two weeks after A« w'ent away. My dear husband was most attentive and
               indefatigable in his care of me, staying up with me almost every night, and
               administering every dose of medicine himself. With all their care, I did not suffer
               for want of attention, but was uneasy during lucid intervals about the housework, and
               for fear A« and M.A. should be overdone."</p>
            <p>"10th mo. 15th. Our English package has arrived at last after considerable delay in
               Xew York, and detention by the way. ... It was so pleasant to see things just as your
               dear hands had packed them, I wish you could both have been in one corner of our
               sitting-room and seen it unpacked. It was a blustering, dark, rainy evening, about
               seven o'clock, when the cry went forth ' the English package is come, bring a
               lantern.' Then John went out, and Charles to help unload it, and C. to hold the
               light, M.A. and L.A. (my servant pro tem.) to look on. I feared the cold wind, and
               obeyed John's strict charge to remain in the house. In a few minutes the case was in
               the dining-room, with a lively company round it. That evening was quite an era in
               J.'s life, and C.'s too. I do not know which of the two was most delighted and
               excited as one pretty thing after another was brought to light. C.'s delight with her
               doll was greatly augmented by her father's exclamations of wonder and astonishment at
               seeing it open and shut its eyes. The slippers he is much pleased with, and the
               knives and steel. He talks of writing to acknowledge them himself, but in the
               meantime, I may tell you that they have been sources of great gratification to him.
               You cannot at all understand the sensation excited here by the arrival of ' a package
               from England.' There were fifty things at least that were quite curiosities here to
               this farming population, who seldom go from home except to market, and do not see
               many things beside farm products. For my presents, I am very much obliged." . . .</p>
            <p>"10th mo. 30th. I am forty-five to-day. My ancle is still swelled and rather lame,
               but I can walk a quarter of a mile without suffering much inconvenience. It is eleven
               weeks since I hurt it. We have had a great many callers to see our ' English
               curiosities,' which we hear are common topics of conversation in our neighbourhood.
               ... Of C.'s enjoyment with all her treasures, her beautiful little box and its
               contents, I will leave her to tell. She has begun a letter to you. Accept my thanks,
               my dear sisters, for all the pains you have taken in purchasing and packing for me. I
               shall take great delight in doing as much for you some day. . . . John spent
               yesterday afternoon pruning his peach trees. He has a fine peach orchard, two or
               three hundred trees. He hopes to have the pleasure of offering you some peaches from
               them some day. He came to fetch me to the cellar just now to look at his fine show of
               winter apples. They certainly do look beautiful. There are about 130 bushels. Some of
               them are remarkably fine. He pointed to a large bin of the finest and said, ' There,
               I wish I could deliver that bin of apples, just as they are, to our English relatives
               ! ' There were fifty bushels in the bin. Some of them will measure fourteen or
               fifteen inches round the largest part.<note n="1">He did send over two barrels of
                  these splendid apples, far larger than an}' grown in England</note> We have not
               nearly so many apples this year as sometimes. We have raised nearly 1,000 bushels of
               grain this year; perhaps some of it may go to England. The crops in this country have
               turned out remarkably well, except potatoes, they are 'some' rotten, but not
               altogether spoiled."</p>
            <p>Writing from Rollin, 23-11-61, E.L.C. says : " I have been to Richmond to attend the
               Indiana Yearly Meeting, and to Cincinnati, to the Sabbath School Convention. Both
               were seasons of novel and lively interest. The Yearly Meeting is a w^onderful sight.
               Friends in thousands, crowding into the meeting-house yard, which covers an area of
               many acres, in their various styles of carriages, from the neat glass coach to the
               tilted w^agon, and the open lumber w^agon. The house crowded, on First-day
               particularly. Friends, seated fifty in a row, and from twenty-five to thirty rows, on
               the ground floor, as well as multitudes in upstairs galleries, and 3,000 holding
               meeting in the open air, outside the meeting-house, far enough off for the faint
               sound of the voice of the distant preacher now and then to be heard within the walls.
               Enos Pray, the most popular preacher in that Yearly Meeting, with a stentorian voice,
               electrifies with his eloquence the thousands out of doors. I wanted much to be there,
               but I had a bad cold, and as it was a drizzling rain and wet under foot, all the
               women were advised to remain in the house, and I lost that treat, and scarcely heard
               this powerful preacher at all. At Cincinnati we had a most animated, spirit-stirring
               discussion, on matters of deep interest, connected with education in Sabbath Schools.
               About 250 present; 150 delegates from various parts of the union. Sister R.S.B. and I
               from Michigan, and some from every Yearly Meeting, except North Carolina, and a
               refugee Friend, who had fled from that state, was present. Men and women in about
               equal proportion. The discussion was ably carried on both by men and women
               indiscriminately. After the Convention we went to see Benjamin Frankland's school^ He
               has many hundred of the lowest class of children from the very dregs of that large
               city, in a most interesting Sabbath School. He is a son of Thomas Frankland, of
               Liverpool, once a noted minister amongst Friends; he was at Ackwortli when I left
               that school, being then a very little boy. Agnes, Mary, and Anna are his sisters. I
               had a very pleasant visit with them and their mother, now living near Cincinnati.</p>

            <p>B.F. spends two hours with these degraded, ignorant little ones every First-day. They
               sing a good many sweet hymns, a young woman accompanying them on an accordion. Their
               young voices, in unison, singing thus, seemed sweet harmony to my ears. ... I have
               been absent on my late journey seven weeks; sister R.S.B. was my companion. After
               leaving Cincinnati, and spending two hours on the Kentucky mountains, we went in a
               north-easterly direction, visiting the meetings of Friends in Alum Creek Quarterly
               Meeting, Ohio, &amp;c. This journey occupied more time than I expected, and I have
               returned that mintite, and procured another for visiting our State's prison at
               Jackson, the Juvenile Penitentiary at Lansing, to hold meetings in many of the cities
               and villages in this State, the Northern Quarterly Meeting in Indiana, and some other
               service that will probably occupy me two or three months.</p>
            <p>"As far as I can see in the dim distance, Canada may then be my course. . .</p>
            <p>"After one meeting I was at, a pleasant friendly- looking man (not of our Society),
               came and advised me not to speak on peace any more, 'or you will he niohhed,' he
               said, 'for the people won't bear it.'</p>
            <p>"The war spirit seems to prevail over every other feeling. Farmers complain
               grievously of the badness of the times. Produce of all kinds, raised on the farms,
               sells very low, and those things we have to purchase from other parts, groceries,
               cotton goods, &amp;c., are very high. Tea and coffee three times their usual price,
               raisins, sugar, rice, almost beyond our reach. Friends and others are leaving off the
               use of tea and coffee very generally, and substituting rye, barley, Indian corn,
               wheat and oats roasted for coffee, and hyssop, catnip, sage, &amp;c., for tea.</p>
            <p>"We have had about sixty meetings in cities and villages, and ex23ect to have about
               twenty more, and then return our minutes to our Monthly and Quarterly Meetings in
               Third month.</p>
            <p>"Upon returning this minute, I have some prospect of requesting another for Canada,
               New York State, Philadelphia Yearly Meeting, and some appointed meetings with those
               out of our Society. The States' Prisons of New York and Pennsylvania it is probable I
               may visit also. I have entertained the hope that my dear John would go with me to
               Canada, but it seems doubtful.</p>
            <p>"Yes, I believe that preaching is one great and powerful agency by which God is
               pleased to arouse, awaken, and convert man. That now, as formerly, He is ' pleased by
               the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.' There is a joy and rejoicing
               in my heart when visiting the sick and the prisoners, the suffering and dying, to
               hear ' the blessing of him that is ready to perish ' in my ear.</p>
            <p>"I know that I have a gift to comfort the afflicted, and for this power I do thank
               God, and strive to exercise it whenever and wherever I can. I would not give away
               this precious gift for a large property. I have no unity with that sort of preaching
               that says 'I have tried to be excused,' 'I am reluctant to occupy the time of this
               meeting,' 'I have spoken because I dared not keep silence.' But I rejoice in my gift,
               and it is willingly that I use it, attending to the injunction ' Whatsoever thy hand
               findeth to do, do it with thy might.'</p>
            <p>"I rejoice that to me is given a dispensation of the gospel, and I rejoice in 'the
               recompense of the reward.'"</p>

            <p>Rollin, 17-4-61</p>
            <p>THIS letter would have been finished sent off a month ago, but I have been so much
               from home of late. We have been round, holding public meetings, and visiting the sick
               and dying, and attending funerals. The other day I received a lawyer's letter
               enclosing a very unusual kind of summons, viz., an urgent request to ' come and
               preach a funeral sermon for my mother, who heard you preach at Hudson one day, and
               wished you to be invited to preach a funeral sermon for her.' Such requests are very
               common here, we have one every week on an average. This lawyer sent his man 17 miles
               for us, over such roads as you would never see in England. We were six hours going,
               and five-and-a-half returning, and were from home two days. You will, perhaps, wonder
               that we should accept such an invitation. It would be thought very strange in
               England, but here it is very common with Friends. When invited, they rarely refuse.
               There are many persons not Friends, whose mothers or fathers, or some of their
               connexions have been Friends, and who prefer a 'Friends' funeral.'</p>

            <p>"18th 4th mo., 1861. Our country, just now, is in a state of great excitement. Civil
               war has commenced in the South. In this ' North Countrie,' we are removed far from
               the scene of warfare, and see and hear comparatively little of it; yet, just now, the
               excitement is so great that it even reaches us. The President has ordered 75,000
               troops to be raised to quell the rebellion in the South; Fort Sumter is reported
               taken by the Carolinians."</p>
            <p>Writing from Rollin, 25-7-1861, E.L.C. says (after referring to some photographs they
               had had taken) : " But in the present state of affairs in our country, it seems
               trifling to be talking of likenesses, or caring about anything so trivial, and, while
               I write, I feel so much uncertainty whether my letters will ever reach your hands,
               that it takes away most of the pleasure of writing. It is so long since I have heard
               from either of you. I believe this is the fourth letter I have written since hearing,
               and as I hear nothing from any of my English relations or friends, I conclude some of
               your letters are lost. In the present troubled state of our nation, our mails and
               everything else are very uncertain. We have now reached a terrible crisis in this
               land. Fearful accounts reach us daily of war and bloodshed, affecting details of
               killed and wounded. The latest account tells us of the total defeat of the
               Northerners at Manasses Junction, with a loss of 3,000 men, besides many wounded. The
               poor wounded soldiers claim our earnest sympathy, where, upon the space of one square
               mile, 3,000 dead are lying, with multitudes of wounded mixed up with them. How
               fearful must be the sufferings of the latter, in that warm country, at this sultry
               season, lying there almost incapable of moving^ and their friends driven off the
               field, and compelled to retreat to the place from which they started. We begin to
               look forward, with serious apprehension, to the end of all this. The effect of the
               excitement in the country is disastrous. Trade and commerce are almost at a
               standstill; forty per cent, of the shopkeepers in New York and many other cities have
               failed. Many of the manufactories are closed. Taxes and rates rising. Tariff upon
               tea, coffee, sugar, and other groceries so great that many of us farmers are almost
               discontinuing the use of them . Farm produce very low. Wool that sold last year for
               fifty cents, now fetches twenty-two. Wheat is only fifty cents per hushel, i.e. forty
               poiinds of flour. Its common price is from ninety-five cents to one dollar
               twenty-five cents. Cutting off the supplies from the Southerners seems to make grain
               a drug in the market. My dear husband and other farmers around here sensibly feel
               these things. We ought to be thankful for the abimdcmce of our harvest just gathered
               in; a most excellent crop, so that we have plenty of provisions, but money we seldom
               see John is always willing to go with me to all the meetings, and to take me anywhere
               in the work of the ministry where my mind seems drawn, if he can possibly leave his
               work. But if this fearful civil war goes on, I do not know what we shall do. We shall
               not be able to go out thus, nor shall we have the means. More than this, the way will
               not be clear before us, or the minds of the people be open to receive us. A strong
               prejudice against our Society seems springing up, because of our testimony against
               war; people look upon us as a sort of half-secessionists, because we will not fight
               for the Union, and oppose all war. It is wonderful how^ high the w^ar spirit runs,
               and how eager the people are to fight or to hear that they are fighting. . . . If
               times mend^ brother W. and sister R.B. and I hope to attend the Indiana Yearly
               Meeting, which commences Second of Tenth Month. It is about 200 miles from here. I
               hope you will write to me as often as you can, and do not 2Kiy your letters, then
               those that may be lost will have cost nothing but the time. I do not pay my letters
               out of ' The Union '; what a mockery that word seems now ! We begin to apprehend that
               the balance of power between the North and South is more equal than we had supposed.
               With characteristic self- respect and independence, the Northerners have all along
               thought themselves infinitely superior to the South, and have boasted that they would
               soon crush the rebellion and punish the rebels; and now our eyes seem suddenly
               opening to perceive that they too have power, and that they may prevail and punish
               us, at least for awhile."</p>
            <p>Mississiniwewa, Indiana. 20-2-1862. My dear Sisters, "Since writing my last, six
               weeks ago, I have accomplished this much of my minute, viz., visited the prisoners in
               the House of Correction at Lansing, the capital of our state, situated 100 miles
               north of Rollin, and had a meeting in the Senate House with the members of onr State
               Legislature, and one with the citizens of Lansing. In these somewhat formidable
               engagements, it has been a great comfort to me to have the company of my dear
               husband. We went with our own horses and buggy. We took a round of about 400 miles,
               total cost being about $15 or £3. In the round we went, we paid a visit to some of
               John's relatives. ... In the Senate House I felt myself in a place altogether new.
               Upon entering the house, the Sergeant-at-Arms marshalled us up to our seats. I had to
               sit in the Speaker's chair, on a high elevation, a sort of throne. Above me was a
               spread-eagle, blazoned in gold, around me soft velvet cushions, crimson hangings,
               rich tassels, etc., etc. All my surroundings were new and strange; before me, the
               members of our State Legislature. Some were writing, some reading newspapers, etc.
               John whispered to me that I had better explain that it was a religious meeting, and
               our usual modes of commenciug our meetings. I said a few words to this effect. A most
               profound silence ensued, which was broken by the Sergeant-at- Arms again marching up
               to us, to tell me 'it was not time to begin; we must wait until half past seven,' it
               being then only a quarter past seven, and half past seven being the usual time for
               meeting there. He then made a similar announcement to the congregation. The writing
               and reading were then resumed by some, others sat still. At half past seven, the
               Sergeant near the door kept looking up at the clock, and then at us, and finding all
               his signs were ineffectual, he once more came to us and announced, ' It is time to
               begin.'</p>

            <p>Rather an unusual mode of proceeding in a Friends' Meeting ! I felt dismayed and
               somewhat losing con- fidence, but I endeavoured to look to the source whence alone
               strength is to be found, and after a pause, felt able to rise above the fear of man,
               and to declare to that large and formidable audience, that 'Righteousness exalteth a
               nation, but sin is a reproach to any people.' I had to point out the national sins of
               this nation; slavery, scepticism, infidelity, and coveteousness among the higher
               classes ; swearing, drunkenness, and depra- vity among the poor. I pointed out the
               responsibilities resting upon the legislators, in their speeches, votes, and
               influence, as well as their example. The many proofs in past history, of sin not only
               bringing reproach, but ruin, upon flourishing nations and cities, viz., Egypt,
               Babylon, Nineveh, Jerusalem, Rome. I dwelt upon the character and disposition of
               Moses, as a model legislator, not seeking his own pleasure or emolument, but the
               welfare of the people over whom he ruled, etc. The meeting lasted about two hours
               w^ith very little silence, and after its close the members came crowding round John,
               and wishing 'to be intro- duced to his lady.' The Lieutenant-Governor w^as very kind,
               and urgently invited us to go and visit him." . .</p>
            <p>"The meeting at the House of Correction was a very different scene. Young people
               varying in age from seven to eighteen years, were there, 156 in number. They spend
               five hours per diem in study, five in labour, two in active play. They seem to be in
               excellent order, warm and clean clothing, and good and substantial plain fare. One
               little fellow, having heard us say we were going to the States Prison, sidled up to
               me and enquired ' Have you any connection at the States Prison? ' I spoke kindly to
               the poor child, and felt my heart touched with near sympathy when he told me that '
               his mother was dead, and his father in the States Prison.'"</p>
            <p>. . . . "The fearful excitement that prevailed respecting England, and fears that she
               would inter- meddle and help the South, seem to be subsiding. T am ashamed of my
               native land, when I think of their threatening attitude, and their imperious demand
               of Mason and Slidell, under present circumstances. I united in the opinion prevalent
               here, that they would not have taken such a step, but for the present tried and
               conflicting state of this nation. What do they want with our rebels, and why, in a
               time of strict neutrality, did the British captain assist them in running our
               blockades? These are queries put to me to which I can find no answer, except the one
               current here, that they are acting in a mean and cowardly manner, because at the
               present crisis, they feel their own strength and our weakness, and so try to provoke
               a war. But I cannot believe that the best men in England approve or sanction the
               step. Did John Bright? My husband wishes particularly to know.</p>
            <p>"Our Peace Society has turned and goes with the stream, and advocates this war as a
               mere sustaining the power of the civil magistrate, and keeping up the government. Too
               many of our Society have turned also, and laid down our Peace principles. When we
               applied for the Legislative Hall for our meeting, they made enquiry whether 'the lady
               was going to speak against the war,' &amp;c."</p>
            <p>Lcqjort, Indiana, fifteen miles south of Lake Michigan, 3mo., 1862.</p>
            <p>"We have stood upon the southern shore of Lake Michigan, and we have visited the
               States Prison for the northern division of Indiana in the City of Michigan. It w^as
               an affecting sight. The chaplain of the prison escorted us, and introduced us there,
               and gained permission for me to have an audience of the prisoners, near three hundred
               in number. The sight of their misery and wretchedness almost overpowered me. It was
               Avell that I had an hour to recover my composure, after first seeing them in their
               cells, before they were assembled for our meeting. Some of their countenances bore
               the impress of hardened depravity and vice. Others looked indifferent and apathetic,
               and some ashamed and distressed. I spoke to them for about an hour, on the mercy of
               God to the penitent sinner, referring to David, Peter, the thief on the cross, and
               the prodigal son. I referred to their happy innocence in childhood's hours, their
               mothers' care and fathers' counsels, and I saw many heads bowed low, and countenances
               with an expression of softness and awakened feelings while I appealed to memories of
               their mothers, sisters, wives, and little ones. I urged upon them the importance of
               cherishing every right feeling, and fostering every good impression and resolution,
               as these beginnings of a better life, though small at first, would grow if encouraged
               — that the commencement of both good and evil in our hearts is small at first, yet
               may largely increase, and illustrated my meaning by tracing the growth of evil and
               sin in their hearts since they first began to wander from the paths of rectitude.
               When I had finished, cousin P. B. Hathaway, my companion, offered a very appropriate
               prayer. When our meeting ended we mingled with them, and entered into conversation,
               many of them pressed round us eager to shake hands, and asked us to come again. A
               company of fifteen or twenty was introduced to me by their chaplain, with the
               announcement ' Mrs. Comstoek, these men have resolved to lead different lives.' I
               shook hands with the little group, and spoke a few words of encourage- ment to them
               to persevere in their resolution. They urgently requested me to stay and attend their
               prayer meeting, which they have got up amongst themselves. I would willingly have
               done so, but we had to hasten to a meeting we had appointed for the citizens in the
               Methodist Church."</p>
            <p>1813-3-62. We are working home gradually, holding meetings in most of the cities and
               villages as we move along. In three days I hope to see the beloved ones at home
               again. W. H. has driven us from place to place with his team and sleigh. When we
               reach home we shall have travelled near one thousand miles in six or seven weeks by
               sleigh — at a cost of about three dollars each."</p>
            <p>After sending messages of loving remembrance to several dear relatives she says,"
               Please let them know the reason of my long silence is not forgetfulness, but from the
               pressure of duties that occupy my time so fully. My meeting with the legislative body
               at Lansing, Michigan, was a regularly appointed meeting. About three-quarters of the
               senate and legislature were there, and two or three hundred of the citizens of
               Lansing also. We have visited some prisons, alms- houses, and hospitals in Delaware,
               New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, but we have yet to go through New York and Canada, and
               may not get home for two months. We do not work every day quite so hard as the one I
               described to you, but are seldom less than six hours per diem engaged in our mission,
               and First-day much more. There has been great openness to receive us. The Twelfth
               Street Meeting, Philadelphia, was very cordial to us, and that Monthly Meeting read
               our minutes, and expressed great satisfaction and unity with our labours amongst
               them. They were exceed- ingly kind to us out of meeting also, and did all they could
               for our comfort and help. . . There is so much refinement, mental cultivation and
               true hospitality, cordiality and benevolence. They are foremost in all the
               philanthropic movements, and principal in all the noble institutions."</p>
            <p>E. L. C. to her Sisters.</p>
            <p>New York, 7-6-1862. "Friends here are like those amongst whom our lot was cast in
               Philadelphia, very kind. Robert L. Murray and his wife, at whose house we are
               staying, are very pleasant Friends. His father, nephew of the grammarian, died about
               the time of the great money panic in 1857. Robert's anxieties at that time so preyed
               upon his health and spirits, that he was taken very ill; for awhile his life was
               despaired of, but gradually he recovered, though for six months he was too ill to
               attend to business at all. There is a chastened, subdued manner about him still, that
               it is touching to see. His wife struggled manfully with her trials, she bore them
               with true woman's fortitude as long as her husband required her care; then her spirit
               flagged and her health sunk, and by the time her husband was restored to health, she
               was prostrated. I have been reading parts of your very interesting letters to them.
               They both unite with my view, and the view taken by the author of ' Doing and
               Suffering,' as to the source whence our trials come. ' Whom the Lord loveth He
               chasteneth, and correcteth every son whom He receiveth.' This is our motto. This our
               comfort. ' As gold is tried in the fire, so are acceptable men in the furnace of
               affliction.' ... It seems to us all a strong argument in favour of this view of the
               case, that the most righteous men in all ages have generally had the greatest
               afflictions. The children of this world, wiser in their generation than the children
               of light, do not get into these business troubles quite so much. The most covetous
               man is often the richest; the proudest and most ambitious manages to gain the most
               power. Why, it seems to us that you hold the same views that Job's three friends had.
               They were for charging him with being the cause of all his own afflictions. They
               thought he must have been wicked, or he could not have had so much trouble. I wish
               you could view the matter as I do, you would be much happier. F. thinks I take more
               comfort in life than you do. The difference lies here. My trials I can look upon as
               coming directly from the loving hand of a tender Father, so I can bear them, and hope
               some day to arrive at the state the Apostle was in when he said, 'I rejoice in
               tribulation.' We have had a very good Yearly Meeting, longer than usual, and many
               Friends from other Yearly Meetings present. E. M., from New England, green in old
               age. F. W. T. an able and eloquent pleader for the faith once delivered to the
               saints, very skilful on doctrinal points, a man in the prime of life. J. H. D.,
               twenty-nine years of age, with wonderful eloquence and command of language, preaches
               the unsearchable riches of Christ. The doctrine of the atonement, of salvation by
               Christ, seems his favourite theme. These two last named are both from Indiana. J. S.,
               from Baltimore. W. J., from Western Yearly Meeting. J. S., from New Jersey,
               Philadelphia Yearly Meeting, though residing only a few miles from this city. Our
               Yearly Meeting has been conducted in great harmony, ample time was allowed for the
               ministry, and great encouragement given to those from other Yearly Meetings. I have
               just mailed L. a New York Tribune. There is nothing very particular in it except a
               short account of our Yearly Meeting, which R. L. M. wrote at the particular request
               of one of the editors, who wished him to write something that would show the
               difference between our views and the Hicksite doctrines. The Yearly Meeting of
               Hicksites concluded just after ours commenced. R. B. M. was there, and, by her strong
               and unitarian doctrine, she has quite alarmed their bodj^ very few of them being able
               to go with her. . . . . About recording ministers, there might be some advantages in
               doing away with the practice. I believe it was resorted to in the dark ages of our
               Society, to encourage a right ministry, and suppress a spurious one. You might get on
               better without this form in England than we should here. I imagine that here there
               might be many more travelling than would be for the good of the Church, for the
               honour of truth, or their own private benefit, if this needful ceremony of
               recommending and liberating was not required. . . .</p>
            <p>John Bright is the most popular man in this city, and in Philadelphia, I believe. I
               see very little of the newspapers and know very little of what is passing in the
               political world, beyond what the last page of the ' Friends' Review ' gives once a
               week. I cannot get time to read the papers, and our own are so little to be depended
               on. Unless we read the whole paper, we are sure to get a false impression, as I did
               when I read Tennessee had surrendered and become loyal. I read two whole columns one
               day, containing the most astounding intelligence, and as soon as I commenced the
               third, ' Later news ' contradicted all the other two contained. The editors do in
               this way to attract notice and to sell their papers John and I do not take any
               political paper. We take no pleasure in reading the horrid details of the
               battle-field. We long and pray for the day when the proclamation of peace may be made
               ; when the swords shall be beaten into ploughshares, and the spears into
               pruning-hooks, and the nations shall not learn war any more. ... As I came into New
               York Harbour last week I had a good view of the 'Great Eastern,' lying near this
               city. It is one of the wonders of the age, but I suppose it is not a remunerative
               concern. . . . Cousin P. B. H. (our husbands are second cousins) is my companion in
               this journey. . . . We are very much engaged from 9 a.m. to 5 or G p.m. in visiting
               the prisons, hospitals, almshouses, poorhouses, orphan, blind, lunatic, and other
               asylums, &amp;c., &amp;c. Yesterday we went to the ' Tombs,' a large prison in the
               very heart of this city, a sort of Newgate. It was a mournful sight to me to see the
               hardened, depraved, degraded countenances of some of the poor women there; yet there
               w^as evidence during our meeting w^ith them that they were not wholly lost to
               feeling. My dear sisters, it is a blessing if we can do anything to encourage, to
               comfort, to soothe these poor outcasts and wanderers; if we may only be the favoured
               instruments of leading a few of them to seek to walk in a happier and belter course.
               There are thousands of children in this city from three to eighteen or nineteen
               years, in houses of refuge, houses of correction, reform schools, and asylums of
               various kinds. We saw about two thousand; had meetings with them last First-day. They
               were classi- fied, the Nurseries containing those under seven. I spoke to them a
               short time, trying to give them a little lesson on the goodness of God in taking care
               of them, as manifested in the different parts of their bodies, the eye, ear, foot,
               and hand. When I told them of a pretty little boy of six years old I had seen a few
               days before in a hospital, who had gone too near some machinery and had his hand so
               injured that it had to be taken off, some of the pretty little creatures held up
               their hands and looked at them, and I think rejoiced for once in their lives over
               their two useful hands, their eyes, and their feet. It is very touching to go to the
               hospitals and see the suffering there, and it is very-sweet to feel that the poor
               sufferers are a little soothed and cheered by our loving words of sympathy."</p>

            <p>IN July, 1862, Elizabeth L. C. wrote The war news are terrible, more and more awful
               as the strife goes on. We hear of many young Friends taking up arms for the North.
               One day three young soldiers were conversing together in Maryland, when one of them
               used the plain language accidentally. ' It seems to me you are a Quaker,' said
               another. 'Yes,' he said, ' I am a son of Dr. Tobey.' (Dr. T. is the clerk of the New
               England Yearly Meeting.) ' Well,' said the second, 'you have heard of Sybil Jones, I
               guess, she is my mother.' Their surprise had scarcely subsided, when the third
               announced himself as the son of William Henry Chase, an eminent minister at Union
               Springs, and a leading man on the committee of our</p>
            <p>Yearly Meeting School. . . .</p>
            <p>"We have paid a visit of spirit-stirring yet harrow- ing interest to Sing Sing, the
               largest State prison in this land. There are 1,250 men, and 150 women in it. The
               chaplain seems to be a very good man, a self- denying, dedicated Christian, who
               labours indef atigably for the comfort and spiritual aid of the prisoners. It is
               beautiful to see the love and reverence they bear him, some of them I should say.
               Others look too hardened to appreciate his 'life of self-renouncing love.' Mary Wood,
               wife of William Wood, clerk to New York Yearly Meeting, accompanied us, and several
               other Friends. M.W. spent two days with me in going from cell to cell amongst the
               prisoners. One poor woman attracted our sympathy greatly. She is a beautiful woman,
               refined and pleasant in her manners, her conver- sation very intelligent, except
               occasionally when some mental aberration is apparent. She was born in Quebec of
               wealthy parents, and delicately brought up until the age of sixteen with every
               indulgence and refine- ment that wealth could give. At sixteen she was engaged in
               marriage to a young man whom she loved devotedly, but her parents thought him not
               quite equal to her in birth and family, and they separated her from him, and
               compelled her to marry a young Englishman of aristocratic family, an officer in the
               army, although she told him at the altar that she did not love him, and never could,
               for her heart was irrevocably given to another. After their marriage, her husband
               took her to England. She does not complain of his being unkind to her at all, but
               says her heart was broken, and she could not love him, though he tried to win her
               love. From the time of her leaving Canada, she was subject occasionally to attacks of
               mental derangement, produced by distress of mind. In the hope of restoring her to
               health and peace, her husband travelled on the Continent with her for three years —
               in vain. When in her twentieth year, she was in Liverpool, and went on board a
               Canadian ship, left her husband, returned to Canada, and presented herself at her
               father's door, the home of her childhood, from which she was spurned with a torrent
               of reproaches. The young man she had so loved was dead. With a weakened mind, the
               poor outcast wandered about from place to place, finding no rest, and fell an easy
               prey to the seductions of a man whom she calls her protector. For four years she
               seems to have been provided with great abundance. There is some incoherency in this
               part of her narrative, but as nearly as the chaplain can gather it, this ' protector
               ' was a very wealthy man, who occasionally visited her, and kept her living in
               luxury, but she was subject at intervals to distressing attacks, and uncontrollable
               outbursts of mental derangement and insanity. In one of these she put some poison
               (arsenic) in some beer, and gave a glass each to two poor people, who drank it, and
               both died from the effects thereof, in a few hours. There seemed to have been no
               motive to have led to this crime, she owed them no grudge, she mixed the poison in
               the beer, in their presence, and told them it was sugar. She made no attempt at
               concealment, did not try to hide herself, or deny what she had done, but laboured
               under the delusion that her own life was in danger, that some enemies were watching
               to injure her, and always carried a revolver about with her. She was arrested and
               convicted of murder, and sentenced to be executed. When told of her sentence, she
               manifested the most extravagant joy. When told afterwards that through the
               philanthropic efforts of some individuals, her sentence had been changed to
               imprisonment for life, she was in paroxysms of grief and distress, tore her hair and
               her clothes, and was so violent that she was kept in chains in the black dungeon for
               some time. When she was first arrested she was most magnificently attired; now, of
               course, she is in prison dress. She has been eight or nine years a prisoner in Sing
               Sing prison, and during that long space of time, no friend or relative has ever been
               to see her, or enquired after her. She is now thirty-three years of age, and is in
               prison for life. The matron says she is generally quiet and manageable, but
               occasionally violent, and then she is placed in * the black dungeon,' where not a ray
               of light penetrates, and kept there until quiet, perhaps two or three days; then
               exhausted she is brought back to her cell. I spent half an hour with her, she was
               quiet and tranquil, and conversed not only rationally, but with much feeling. Her
               spirit seems to be galled by the society into which she is thrown in the prison, more
               than anything else. They are repulsive to her, and they dislike her and call her
               proud, and talk of her 'airs.'</p>
            <p>Poor thing! my heart aches for her, but I cannot help her ! The chaplain often goes
               to her when she is depressed or excited, and soothes her. She speaks of him as the
               only person in the wide world who cares for her, and sometimes speaks touchingly of
               her childhood's days, and the love and care she enjoyed then. . . ."</p>
            <p>The Society of Friends has always denounced war as unchristian, and the heart-rending
               scenes Elizabeth L. C. witnessed during the American War, of which John Bright in his
               excellent Peace address in 1887 said it was the only war during the past fifty years
               for which he thought any palliation could be made—show, indeed, how cruel and
               inhuman, and foolish and wicked it is.</p>
            <p>E.L.C. witnessed terrible sufferings, and could at times scarcely speak of them
               without a shudder. In one letter she says : — " It is harrowing to see the sufferings
               of the poor wounded soldiers; I have heard piercing shrieks from them as I walked
               outside, while the wounds were being dressed, and the limbs amputated."</p>
            <p>. . . " I went into a hospital in Virginia one day. A youth of about nineteen seemed
               to be dying. The soldier who was waiting upon him said, ' It's of no use for you to
               speak to him — he don't know nothing.' He had been badly wounded in the battle of
               Fredericks- burg — lay thirty-six hours on the battlefield before he was picked up,
               and brought to the hospital, and during the two or three days he had been there, had
               not been able to answer any questions, or give any information; had only spoken in
               incoherent ramblings, or in the ravings of delirium. I enquired his name, but they
               could not tell it : said the nurse and doctor had both been trying in vain to find
               out; I asked for his knapsack, thinking that by searching it I might find some paper,
               book, name or initials, by which he might be identified. In vain, for knapsack, coat,
               cap and belt had all been lost on the battle-field. I stood looking upon the youthful
               face, and remembering that there is one Name that will sometimes reach the dying ear,
               and touch a chord of memory when all others were forgotten, I said, —</p>
            <quote><p>'Jesus can make a dying bed</p>
               <p>Feel soft as downy pillows are, While on His breast I lean my bead,</p>
               <p>And breathe my life out sweetly there.'</p></quote>

            <p>He opened his eyes, and, with an earnest appealing look at me, tried to speak. There
               was sufficient of memory and of reason left for him to remember his mother, and of
               sight to see that a woman stood beside him; and, mistaking me for his far-distant
               mother, he said, ' Mother, I knew you would come.' I longed to know that another
               name, besides that of mother, was precious in that solemn hour, and I spoke of Him
               who said, ' As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you.' I spoke of Him
               whom God hath highly exalted, and hath given Him a name that is above every name,
               that ' at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, and every tongue confess that
               Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.' Again the large blue eyes
               opened, and rested upon me with an appealing look, and he spoke once more. Listening
               attentively, I caught the words, uttered with feeble, faltering accents, 'Mother, I
               am going to Jesus.' They were the last he spoke. I tried vainly to get the mother's
               name; the lucid interval had passed away, or the power of speech was gone. I stood
               beside him until his voice was silenced by the hand of death, and closed his
               eyes.</p>
            <p>"Looking carefully to see if there was anything by which he could be identified and
               his mother discovered, I saw upon the little finger of his left hand a gold ring. The
               hand had been tightly clasped, as if he had^desired to hide or retain it, but when
               death had relaxed his hold, I removed it easily from the thin, wasted finger. I
               thought, perhaps, that by means of it I might discover his friends. Soon, however, I
               replaced it, remembering a sight I had witnessed a few days before, which made me
               think it more likely that some one Avould go there to seek for him, than that I
               should discover his friends by the ring.</p>
            <p>The sight I had witnessed was this. I went into the dead-house, where w^ere the
               bodies of eighteen soldiers waiting for interment. As I stood there, pondering the
               w^onderful mysteries of life and death, thinking of the desolation of the sword in
               our beloved country, there came into the house two mothers, in great grief and bitter
               weeping, searching for their lost sons.</p>
            <p>"They had been looking in the hospitals, in vain, and now came to search in this
               place: and one went to the head and the other to the foot of the same young soldier,
               each claiming him for her own. The faces were so changed, blackened with gunpowder,
               altered by wounds, loss of blood and the hand of death, that a mother would not be
               able to distiuguish her own child. One of the women passing her hand caressingly
               through the hair, and kissing the cold forehead, exclaimed in an agony of grief, 'Oh
               ! Harry, my darling Harry, will your mother never hear your loved voice again? Shall
               I never have that strong young arm to lean upon any more? ' To which the other woman
               responded, ' No it is not your Harry, it is my Charley, I know^ it is my boy by the
               socks which I knit for him, with my own hands.' She took possession of the remains to
               bury her dead at home. The remembrance of this scene led me to replace the ring, and
               a year-and- a-half elapsed ere I discovered the mother of the boy whose dying words I
               referred to. Having stated the circumstances in a meeting, 600 miles from the place
               where the boy had died, a lady came to me in a flood of tears, and said, ' It seems
               to me you have been talking about my dear boy.' She accompanied me to the house where
               I was staying, brought the boy's photo and some of his letters. She told me of their
               parting at the railway station, when he went to join his regiment, and he earnestly
               claiming her promise, ' Mother, you won't forget that if I am sick or wounded, you
               have promised to come to me.' In the last letter he had written, which was just
               before the battle of Fredericksburg, he had again reminded her of her promise, and
               told her that he always wore the gold ring on the little finger of his left hand^
               sending a message to the giver of it. From the mother's description of her boy, a
               lock of hair which I had saved for her, and other concurrent circumstances, it became
               pretty clear that this was her son. And the mother, while she wept over the loss of
               her dear boy, was com- forted with hearing of his last words, and with the
               consolation of the child of the Lord, 'I shall go to him but he shall not return to
               me.' ....</p>
            <p>"During the war the large Hospital for the Insane, in the district of Columbia,
               called St. Elizabeth's Hos- pital, was set at liberty for sick and wounded soldiers,
               the insane patients being removed and provided for farther north. As I entered one of
               the wards the nurse approached me with a very warm greeting, saying how glad she was
               to see me, for yesterday two young soldiers died who had anxiously wished in vain for
               someone to pray with them. I asked where the chaplain had been; she said he was out
               visiting or pleasure-taking with some of the others. She took me to a small room
               where lay a poor young soldier whom she thought very near death. As I stood by his
               bedside, a rough-looking New York soldier, his attendant, said to me, ' It ain't no
               use for you to talk to him, he don't know nothing, and can't talk; he has had a
               bullet through his wind- pipe,' he added, as he snatched roughly the bandages from
               his throat and exposed a ghastly throat and neck, fearfully swelled and inflamed.
               This rough attendant was one of a thousand men who had been imprisoned in the '
               Workhouse ' at Xew York for short terms for drunkenness, vagrancy, &amp;c., to whom
               was given their choice to finish out their sentences or serve in the army; much to
               the indignation of some of the most respectable families, whose sons were in the
               army, were these men allowed to enlist. I replaced the bandage tenderly and
               carefully, and as I looked at the youthful face and open brow I said, ' Poor boy, how
               I wish his mother was here.' The blue eyes opened and he cast an earnest, appealing
               look at me, and seeing he was conscious I spoke a few words to him about mother and
               home, Jesus and heaven. Large tears gathered in his eyes and rolled down his cheeks
               as he made an effort to speak — nothing but inarticulate sounds escaped him. I had a
               little book with me, * Words of healing for the sick soldier,' from which I read him
               a few sentences. He seemed to understand, and looked longingly at the book, which I
               handed to him; my name was in it, and I wrote beneath it ' to,' wishing to add his
               name, but this he could not articulate. I handed him my pencil, and tried to steady
               his hand while he made an attempt at writing his name. He succeeded in indistinctly
               inscribing ' Henry Burhans,' but the effort was too much; book and pencil fell from
               his hand, and he fainted. I called the nurse, and while she endeavoured to restore
               him, I went to speak to the surgeon and officer for the day. I explained the case,
               and enquired if they could tell me where the boy came from, and whether his wounds
               were fatal. In answer to my enquiries, they said that he had not been able to
               articulate a sentence since he was picked up on the battle-field, thirty-six hours
               previously. Both chaplain and nurse had tried to discover who he was in vain, but
               from the part of the battle-field in which he was found it was probable he belonged
               to a New York regiment. He had been robbed of his cloak, cap, belt, and everything by
               which he might have been identified while lying on the battle-field, and was brought
               to the hospital wrapped up in a blanket. The surgeon said his wounds were not
               necessa7nly fatal, but he thought he would die. ' Why? ' I asked. ' Because he will
               not attempt to take any nourishment, and is very home-sick,' adding, 'We lose more
               from home-sickness than we do from wounds.' I returned to my poor patient, determined
               to make further efforts to discover from whence he came. I found him conscious, and
               the nurse was trying to persuade "him to take a little nourishment. She could not
               prevail upon him to make any effort — ' It hurts him dreadfully to swallow,' she
               explained to me, ' and he cannot live unless he take some food.' I told him that the
               surgeon said his wounds were not necessarily fatal, and that he might live, and that
               I was going to write to his mother, and represented what a sad thing it would be if
               she came such a long distance to find him gone. Cheered and animated by these
               tidings, he made a great effort, and succeeded in swallowing a spoonful, though it
               seemed as though it would almost choke him. I handed him a card and pencil to see if
               he could write his mother's post office address. I tried to steady his hand, and held
               the book on which the card lay. Feebly the poor hand moved up and down, back and
               forth, and very earnest was the gaze fixed upon my face as I tried to read the lines
               he had made. A look of disappointment and sorrow passed over his face as I tried
               vainly to decipher it, and tears again filled his eyes. ' Don't be discouraged,' I
               said, ' cheer up, and I think I shall discover thy mother's address.' I dried his
               tears, gave him a clean, soft pocket handkerchief, and said, ' Henry, in a few
               minutes, after thou hast rested, I want thee to try and speak one word, do not
               attempt more, but simply one word, and that one must be thy mother's post office
               town. I will watch the motion of thy lips and listen intently.' Presently I saw he
               was framing to speak, and listening, watching, and guessing, I thought he was trying
               to say 'Catskill.' 'Mrs. Burhans, Catskill, New York,' I said, 'Is that right'? A
               flash of joy lighted up the poor, pale face, as he found I had it right. I talked to
               him a little longer, told him I felt assured he had a good mother, and queried, ' can
               I write to her, and tell her that 'while she has been at home, praying for her
               wandering boy, he has been praying for himself'? I requested him to press my hand if
               I could say so; there was a look of sadness, but he gave no sign. I queried,' can I
               tell her that her dear boy is now seeking his Saviour, that he will now seek his
               soul's salvation'? An earnest pressure of the hand was the response. After a short
               season of prayer, I was about to leave him, when he kept tight hold of my hand, as
               though unwilling to let me go, until I said that I wanted to write to his mother, and
               had only one hour to catch the out-going mail. Instantly he let go. When seated at my
               lodgings, I felt some doubt whether ' Mrs. Burhans, Catskill, New York,' would reach
               his mother, not knowing whether Catskill was simply a mountain range, a district with
               many post offices in it, or a village or town. I therefore wrote to my dear friend,
               Mary Wood, who I knew often spent her summers at Catskill, told her I thought this
               poor boy strongly resembled her only son, gave full particulars, and begged her to do
               all that she could to communicate them to Mrs. Burhans, as quickly as possible. This
               proved satisfactory, and the mother came to her boy, who recovered at least for a
               time.</p>
            <p>I heard of him once or twice after Another very sad case was that of 'Poor Harry.' I
               was walking from one hospital to another, when I saw a man digging what seemed to be
               a grave at the roadside. I stopped and spoke to him as he worked with his pickaxe and
               shovel, and said, ' It looks to me like a grave thou art digging.' He replied, *I am
               digging a grave.' *Well,' I said, 'that is an extraordinary place for a grave — why
               is it not in the cemetery or churchyard?' To which he replied that the grave he was
               digging was for 'a young man who w^as living and well.' From him and some ladies who
               gathered round me, I heard a part of the dismal history, which was afterwards
               corroborated, and completed the story of poor Harry, the only son of a widowed
               mother, far away in Minnesota. His father had died when he was a little infant, in a
               fit of delirium tremens. The mother had moved to a distant part of the country, where
               he was not known, and carefully shielded her little boy and girl from knowing how
               their father had died, and from ever tasting the intoxicating draught. The boy had
               been all that a loving mother could wish till he grew up to be eighteen years of age,
               when the war broke out, and he enlisted in the army. Thinking she was doing a brave
               and a right act, the poor widow gave up her only son, to fight for his country; and,
               taking leave of him at the railway station, as he went to join his regiment, her
               parting charge, as she placed her little Bible in his hand, was, 'Harry, do not
               neglect your Bible, do not neglect prayer, do not forget your Saviour, and remember
               your promise to your mother — you have promised me that you will never drink.'</p>
            <p>"Eight months had scarcely passed away after leaving his mother, until he was
               court-martialled and sentenced to be shot. He had been placed under a drinking
               captain, who had invited him to drink with him. For awhile, he steadily refused,
               saying, 'I have promised my mother that I will never drink.' After a time, it became
               evident that the vindictive-spirited captain resented his refusal to drink with him
               as an insult. One of the young soldier's comrades said to him, 'Harry, you are
               getting out with your captain, you had better not offend him or it will be the worse
               for you.'</p>
            <p>Finding that he was losing the captain's favour, Harry consulted a lady at whose
               house he sometimes visited, who gave him this advice, after hearing the story of his
               promise to his mother and the captain's invitation to him to drink; ' Harry, if your
               mother knew all the circumstances, she would absolve you from your promise. You know
               you need not drink to excess, but just take a glass with the captain, if he invites
               you again, to show good fellowship.' Poor Harry followed the advice, and it was soon
               evident that he had inherited his father's weakness. No sooner had he tasted the
               intoxicating draught than he craved for more, and, under its influence, soon lost all
               self-control, and rapidly ran his down-hill career, until, after frequent acts of
               insubordination and drunkenness, he, one day, knocked his captain down, was tried by
               court-martial, and sentenced to be shot. While I was listening to this sad story,
               unusual sights and sounds attracted my attention. I heard the approaching solemn
               death march of a company of soldiers, their muffled drums beating, who came and
               arranged themselves on one side of a square, another occupied a second side, and
               another a third side, and with the third, in a wagon, seated upon his own coffin, a
               common pine box, was young Harry.</p>
            <p>The young soldier was led out to a rising knoll, and twelve soldiers placed in front,
               armed with guns, taken up indiscriminately, six of which were loaded with bullets,
               and six with blank cartridges, that they might not know who fired the fatal shots. I
               entreated the officer commanding, to delay the execution of the sentence for
               twenty-four hours, that I might have time to hasten to Washington and report the case
               to our noble President, Abraham Lincoln. The officer refused to grant my request, and
               would not even allow me to speak to the prisoner, being urged on by the resentful
               captain, who had caused all poor Harry's troubles, to the immediate execution of the
               sentence. The General remarked that there had been so much drunkenness and
               insubordination among the soldiers, that they must make an example of Harry. Finding
               that I could not help him I hastened away, but did not get out of hearing until the
               signal was given, and the shots were fired that took away that young man's life : and
               Harry fell, covered with wounds inflicted by his own brothers in arms. . . I went to
               Washington shortly after, and represented the case with several others to the
               Secretary of War, Edwin M. Stanton. That kind-hearted gentleman expressed much regret
               that such a circumstance should have transpired, adding, ' It is one of the terrible
               exigencies of war, and such things will sometimes happen in the best regulated
               armies.' My heart was lifted up with the earnest petition, and I wished that all
               mothers and ministers of the Gospel would unite in the same —'Oh I hasten, great
               Father, the blest consummation. When nation shall not haft up sword against nation,
               When war shall no more be the Christian's vocation, When the spear shall be
               severed,and broken the bow.'"</p>

         </div>
         <div type="chapter">
            <p>My dear Sisters, T 7011 will wonder at receiving a letter from me, JL dated from this
               place. Soon after my arrival at home from Canada, I received a minute from my Monthly
               Meeting to visit the Prisons, Hospitals, Houses of Refuge, Asylums, and other
               institutions in many of our large cities, also for going into ' the streets and lanes
               of the cities, to bring in the poor, the maimed, the halt, and the blind ' : and for
               attending the Yearly Meetings of Indiana and Baltimore. There was a very full
               expression of sympathy and unity, and I have a beautiful and comprehensive
               certificate from Rollin Monthly Meeting, endorsed by Adrian Quarterly Meeting, 28-10.
               I have had so much to do since com- mencing this that you must excuse the delay. We
               have had a very good though small Yearly Meeting, not larger than Ackworth Particular
               Meeting was fifteen years ago, including the schools. Eliza P. Gurney was in
               attendance, and ' had good service to the edification and strengthening of many
               minds.'</p>
            <p>"There is a wonderful difference between this Yearly Meeting and Indiana; it is very
               striking thus to come direct from one to the other. My dear Bister, R. S. Beal, came
               with me from home, but could not stay all through this long journey. She was
               unwilling to come so far from home in the present excited con- dition of our country.
               E.Y. is my companion from Cincinnati here, but I hope my dear husband will join me
               before long, and be my companion to the end of this journey. I have many a
               heart-sinking and home- yearning, and a longing for the home circle. I have the
               likenesses of my dear husband and children, and long and earnestly do I look at them.
               But the belief that I am in the path of duty at this present time, and that my
               labours for the benefit of my poor suffering fellow-creatures are blessed, raises me
               above undue depression. Indeed, there are times when I am able to rejoice over my
               gift to comfort those in affliction, even though it leads me so much from those I
               hold dear.</p>
            <p>In visiting the Penitentiary here I found a fine, intelligent man, about thirty-five
               years of age, sentenced for forty-five years for helping a slave with his wife and
               family to escape. They were nine, father and mother and seven children, and five
               years' im- prisonment was the penalty for each. The prisoner had ' harboured ' them,
               given them food, and shown them the way to Pennsylvania. Another man, a coloured
               preacher, a very respectable man, is under sentence for fifteen years for having '
               Uncle Tom's Cabin ' in his house. By the iniquitous laws of this Slave State, not
               only these outrages have been legally perpetrated, but coloured freemen, when
               committed for State Prison offences, have been sold back into slavery in South
               Carolina or other States! These Slave State laws are terrible. If I continue long in
               this State I may get committed to prison for some breach of such laws, or for lifting
               up my voice against them."</p>
            <p>Additional particulars of these cases are given in the next letter.</p>
            <p>Sandy Springs, Maryland, 19-11-62.</p>
            <p>(Six miles from the contending armies.)</p>
            <p>"By the date of this you will perceive that I am still out on a journey. My minute is
               an extensive one, and will probably occupy some months. It is for visiting the
               prisons, hospitals, poor houses, and other institutions in Baltimore, Pittsburg,
               Cincinnati, and other cities, extending as far as Trenton, New Jersey, in the east,
               Cleveland and Chicago on the north, Cincinnati and Baltimore on the south. On the
               west as far as Jeffersonville and the Illinois. In this service I have now been
               engaged eight weeks. In another month I hope my dear husband will join me, and
               continue with me through the winter. Being a farmer, he cannot leave home
               comfortably, except during the winter season. In my present arduous labours, way has
               been remarkably made for me by the most influential members of our Society in the
               cities where Friends reside, and by the prison authorities, &amp;c., where there are
               no Friends. In every institution I have been kindly received, and in most my visits
               have been greatly encouraged by those in authority. Way has been made, not only for
               holding meetings with the prisoners collectively, but for me to visit them from cell
               to cell, and labour with them in private, which visits have seemed very acceptable to
               the poor prisoners, who seldom see the face of one whom they feel to be their friend,
               or hear the voice of sympathy. In the penitentiary for this State, I found one poor
               man incarcerated for forty-five years. He has been here five years, and had forty yet
               to continue. He had helped a family of nine slaves to escape, a father, mother, and
               seven children. They were recaptured, and by the whip and other means of torture, the
               name of the man who had given them assistance was wrung from them. He was torn from
               his comfortable home, his wife and six little children, who are mourning over his
               absence, and reduced from comfort to w^ant the necessaries of life. A very
               respectable free coloured man, a preacher, has been taken from his family and his
               flock, who seem devoted to him, and shut up in the penitentiary for having ' Uncle's
               Tom's Cabin ' in his house; he was sentenced for fifteen years. After serving five
               years, Friends here succeeded in procuring his release, and aiding him out of the
               State. There are now seven prisoners in thepenitentiary for 'harbouring,' or giving
               food or clothing to fugitive slaves. One, a very respectable man, who was in business
               in the city. A beautiful mulatto girl, in great distress, came to his door, begged a
               piece of bread and permission to rest awhile; both were granted, and a few kind words
               spoken to her on parting. There were spies around, seeking her; she was seen leaving
               his house, recaptured, and he was immediately arrested, and taken to prison. When
               tried, he was sentenced to fifteen years' imprisonment in the penitentiary. His shop
               has gone to ruin, his poor heart-broken wife and little daughter are in great
               distress. There seems little prospect that she will ever see her husband again. As I
               stood by this poor man's cell, and tried to comfort him. I told him I would rather be
               a prisoner for what he had done than for anything else, and assured him that I
               thought he had done quite right, and that in a coming world he would receive his
               reward. I reminded him of a higher tribunal, at which he would stand, and where,
               instead of being co7idem7ied for giving food and shelter to a wanderer and outcast,
               he might hear the welcome assurance, ' Inasmuch as ye did it to one of the least of
               these, my brethren, ye did it unto me.' What I said to him seemed to comfort him
               much, and especially when I promised to go and visit his wife and daughter and try to
               comfort them. As I was speaking to him, I saw great uneasiness depicted upon the
               countenances of the three Friends who were with me. Just as I remarked ' I would
               rather be a prisoner for tliat than for anything else,* the dear Friend, my elder,
               touched my arm, and said ' Hush ! there are many eyes upon us, and ears open; and
               thou may'st get a chance of trying how thou wilt like it, if thou speaks so loud.'
               Upon leaving the prison, he explained to me the importance of my being very careful
               what I said, and I am inclined to believe that his counsel was needed, and that his
               kind care may have saved me from being lodged as a prisoner there. It was as much as
               I could do to restrain my indignation, and to forbear lifting up my voice in the
               prison before the authorities, to testify against their iniquitous laws. *What good
               would it do?' said he, 'the result might be for thee to be their fellow-prisoner, but
               I believe thou canst do far more good at large than shut up there I' He furthermore
               represented that by speaking out plainly, I should block up my own way and that of
               many others, who were now able to administer a little consolation and help to the
               poor prisoners, against whom the doors would be closed if they were not ' moderate.''
               Perhaps he may be right, but it is a terrible thing to live in a Slave State and be
               subject to such laws, and to think that the voice of a just and righteous man cannot
               be raised against such iniquity.</p>
            <p>. . . . You are mistaken in supposing that I had been to Congress. I had a meeting, a
               year ago, with our State Legislature in Michigan, and was very well received. It was
               a satisfactory and relieving meeting, but I have not yet been to Washington. I expect
               to go there next week, not to see the President or the legislative body, but the poor
               and suffering in the hospitals, prisons, and asylums, and ' in the streets and lanes
               of the city.' E. P. Gurney visited the President last month. She had some difficulty
               in getting access to him, as he is almost overwhelmed with business; but, after a
               long and patient waiting, she succeeded in obtaining an audience, and had a very
               satisfactory and relieving opportunity. She addressed him in a most appropriate
               manner upon his present perplexities and trials, and directed him to seek for wisdom
               and counsel where alone they can be found. Her sympathy and her counsel seemed very
               acceptable, and when she had done, he took her hand and held it long, while deeply
               moved, he acknowledged how appropriate and acceptable her message had been to him
               under his peculiar and pressing difficulties. I have heard the above particulars
               through one of the Friends who was present. Thus one is sent to the high, another to
               the low, and others to the Churches, and all have the promise, 'As thy day, so
               shall-thy strength be.' The great and good Shepherd condescends to go before, and
               prepare the way for his followers. It is very distressing and harroAving to the
               feelings to see the great sufferings of the poor wounded soldiers. What a terrible
               thing this war is ! I suppose there are now a million men in the field in the
               Northern army, and near 100,000 sick and wounded — 35,000 in and around Washington,
               George Town, and Alexandria D.C., and 12,000 in Baltimore. About half of the latter I
               have seen, and endeavoured, as way opened, to direct the poor sufferers to 'the Lamb
               of God which taketh away the sin of the world.' They eagerly listen, and very urgent
               are their requests, 'Pray for me, pray for me ! ' Poor things ! It is touching to
               hear their cries for their mothers, for the homes of their childhood. The groans, the
               agonised moans, and almost shrieks of the poor sufferers, seem to enter into my very
               soul. But I have felt that it is a blessed commission to comfort the afflicted, to
               soothe the sufferer, to guide the wanderer to the fold. And, my dear brother and
               sister, I may say, notwithstanding the arduous labour, the weariness of the flesh,
               the difficulties and disagreeables of my present duties, the reward is great, the
               peace is sweet, the consolation of feeling myself an humble instrument to administer
               comfort to these sufferers, amply repays the sacrifice made of home comforts, and the
               society of those most dear to me. The cross is sometimes heavy, but the crown is kept
               in view. I serve a good Master. I have not time now to depict the sufferings of the
               poor in the streets and lanes of our large cities. The wretched cellars, destitute of
               outlet for the smoke, or inlet for light and air, except a trap-door on the pavement
               of the street, where mothers with their wretched little ones dwell in squalid
               poverty, vsithout suitable food or clothing, and emphatically dwelling in heathen
               darkness, and in the shadow of death. Oh! that light may spring up amongst them.</p>
            <p>"Washington, 20-12-62. This city is in a fearful state of excitement. The
               Fredericksburg calamity has filled all the North with sorrow, horror, and indignation
               ; great mistrust of those high in authority, suspicion, fear, disloyalty, everywhere
               prevailing. Our prospects are very dark and gloomy. Our President and governors, who
               ought to have our earnest sympathy and our fervent prayers in this time of utmost
               need, are every- where spoken against. In this city, there is a strong current in
               favour of secession. There are elements of rebellion and secession thickly
               interspersed in the North. There are traitors all over the land, and there are those
               who unhesitatingly affirm that we are on the eve of a revolution. Anarchy and
               confusion prevail everywhere. The Cabinet have resigned. There is a freedom of speech
               that is very injurious, and a want of unity. The Contrabands are in a fearful
               condition. Smallpox, measles, fever, croup, carrying them off; fourteen dying in a
               day. In their mortuary, some left unburied two weeks. The greatest want of system and
               order, the same in the hospitals. Government provides plenty of money for sick and
               suffering soldiers, and for Contraband also. But there is a fearful amount of
               peculation, cheating, squandering, etc., etc. The poor soldiers are dying off rapidly
               for want of proper care and nourishment. Alas ! for our poor country ! The North are
               losing everywhere. I hope to leave this city this week. Dorothea L. Dix has kindly
               placed her ambulance and driver at my disposal, to go round to the hospitals in, when
               she is not using them. She is doing a great work for her Lord. She is devoting a
               large income, her time, talents, and strength to the hospitals. Where her influence
               extends, order and cleanliness prevail ; but her sphere is only over one- fourth of
               the whole. The population of the city is about 60,000 generally. Now there are
               180,000 soldiers in and around Washington. All the churches, asylums, and public
               buildings are converted into hospitals, there being 60,000 wounded and sick soldiers
               here now. The mortality in the city is great. There are thirty-six hospitals; the
               surgeon who attends three of them, reports ninety-six deaths in a week in these
               three. Our farming districts are suffering from want of labourers. Mothers, wives,
               and sisters are mourning over their poor murdered boys and men. Murdered we may call
               it, when they are made to stand to be shot at by soldiers behind their entrenchments,
               as at Fredericksburg."</p>

            <p>Philadelphia, 9-1-63.</p>
            <p>"My dear Sisters,</p>
            <p>A sense that you will rejoice in my being safe out of Maryland, Virginia, and
               Delaware, leads me to take an early opportunity of informing you of my safe arrival
               here. I am thankful to feel clear of the Slave States. In Alexandria, Virginia, I
               went into a slave- pen, w^hich had been converted pro tern, into a guard house. It
               was an abominable place. As we drew near, the most fearful imprecations saluted our
               ears, obscene jests, scurrilous abuse, profane oaths, mingled with loud, hollow,
               unearthly laughs. All these noises were restrained for a moment when we entered the
               gloomy regions. Gloomy indeed, high, naked, dirty walls, no light admitted but from
               dingy small windows in the roof. Xo beds, no seats, no fire, no accommodation of any
               kind. The dirt, filth, stench, were beyond description. Into this place were crowded
               forty or fifty men, many of them soldiers. These were some of tbem committed here for
               drunkenness, some for rioting, some for sedition, some for stealing, some for night
               vagrancy, some for immorality, for assault, &amp;c. Many of them, being desperadoes,
               were chained. They were silent a moment as they gazed in astonishment upon us, then,
               after, some exclamations, as ' a lady ! ' ' here's a nice parlour for a lady ! ' '
               can't you find her a chair? ' &amp;c., &amp;c., one ruffian-like looking soldier, who
               looked as though he had been rolling in the mud, the worse for liquor, came right up
               in front of us, and, shaking his manacled hand in our faces, said, ' This is the way
               Uncle Sam treats his brave volunteers, he sends us to stand before a fire as hot as
               hell, at Fredericksburg, and if we escape death there he brings us here to finish us
               up.' This speech produced a laugh from some of the other soldiers. I was chilled with
               horror to look at the hardened, vicious, depraved countenances of the men, and the
               wretched condition they were in. I spoke to them a very few words, to which they
               listened with quiet attention, and we withdrew.</p>
            <p>"The jail in Washington was almost as bad as this slave-pen, as far as impure air and
               filth go. The frequent sight of such extreme wretchedness and misery, has a very
               depressing effect upon my mind. Only to think that these are our brethren, created by
               the same Father, that our blessed Saviour died for them as well as for us. Oh ! why
               is it thus? Why is there such a vast amount of sin and misery in the world? Our
               afflicted country at this time is over- whelmed with an ocean of sin, and deluged
               with blood. The sorrows of the mourning mothers, the widows, orphans, and sisters,
               the sufferings of 100,000 sick and wounded soldiers in the hospitals, rise up before
               a God of mercy. Surely He will hear their cries, surely He will be touched with
               compassion for their affliction, and come down to help them. Battle after battle is
               being fought, and we meet with reverses, both in our army and our navy. What is our
               poor country coming to? We see many mourning, anxious, troubled countenances now.</p>
            <p>"Tell F. and M.C. here is a little story for them, that they may prize their
               privileges, and value the instruction that mamma gives them, in those nice little
               Bible stories. I have been lately holding some meetings and visiting families and
               meetings in the midst of the Alleghany mountains. There in a lovely spot, with high
               hills visible from every door and window in the house, I found a family of ten,
               father and mother and eight children. A bright looking little boy in his eighth year,
               came near to us, and began talking about his father's horses, sheep, and cattle.
               After a little conversation on these topics, my companion began to speak to him on
               more serious matters, his bright, animated, intelligent look passed away, and he
               seemed sorely perplexed. One question my companion J.V, asked him, was 'Johnnie, do
               thee know who made thee ?' It seemed a new idea to the child, and by his look, one
               was prepared to receive the reply of Topsy 'I specs I growed.' He did not say so, but
               he seemed ignorant upon the subject. She pressed him a little further thus, 'Do thee
               know who Jesus Christ is?' The boy looked out of window, up and down the road, and at
               some of the houses of the neighbours, then replied, 'I don't know him, he don't live
               near here.' 'Johnnie, do thee know who takes care of thee V 'Father and mother,' was
               the prompt reply. 'But at night, when father and mother are gone to bed V ' Milton '
               (this Avas his elder brother who slept with him). ' But when Milton and sisters are
               all asleep ' The boy gave an arch look as if he hardly knew whether she was in
               earnest, then said ' I guess no one don't stay awake to take care of me.'</p>
            <p>"In another cottage we found a little girl, who in her ninth year, knew nothing about
               Adam and Eve, and Cain and Abel. She listened with amazement "while I told her the
               story of the Garden of Eden, and its inmates, and of Cain killing his brother. With
               eyes and mouth open, she seemed eagerly drinking in every word, and enquired, ' Where
               did all the rest of the people live, when they were in the garden? Did they have such
               a beautiful garden too? ' When I told her no one else was living then, she was
               astonished, and turned to some girl near her, and said. Only think, there were only
               two people living in the world, how dreadful lonesome it must be ! I'm glad I did not
               live there then.' The girl to whom she said this looked awe-struck, and looking round
               and out of the windows at the ' great world for only two people,' brought out an
               emphatic 'Do tell now!'"</p>
            <p>E. L. C. to L. R. and C. H.</p>
            <p>Philadelphia, 9-1-63.</p>
            <p>"It was a bright, beautiful morning last summer that our party left New York harbour
               in one of those splendid floating palaces that glide over sunny seas, placid lakes,
               and smooth rivers in our western world, for Staten Island, a twelve miles' trip. Our
               party were my companion and self, William Cromwell and daughter, and Hannah
               Underhill. The latter is a sister of Elizabeth U. Willis and of Mary Wood. E. U. W.
               has been for many years Clerk of the Women's Yearly Meeting, New York, and M. W. is
               the wife of William Wood, the Clerk of the Men's Meeting. We arrived at the wharf on
               Staten Island about one o'clock. The Governor, a gentleman of the old school, with a
               sort of stately grace and dignity, met us on the wharf, and welcomed us to the
               island.</p>
            <p>"Arrangements had previously been made for us to have a meeting with the sailors in
               the "Snug Harbor," a comfortable home for superannuated and w^orn-out sailors,
               calculated to accommodate 500; when past going to sea, they end their days here in
               quiet, the sea water of the beautiful bay washing the shore, and they sit in the
               piazzas, summer-houses, on the green, and under the shade of the beautiful and
               ornamental trees, or near the water's edge, smoking their pipes or cigars, and
               reading their newspapers, &amp;c. They each have a comfortable bedroom and easy
               chair, and every comfort that an elderly gentleman can desire. The Governor has been
               fifty years a sailor, and near forty a sea-captain, and is about seventy years of
               age.</p>
            <p>"The same island has three other institutions for sailors, viz., a hospital, a home
               for their waives and widows, and a school for sailors' children. After his cordial
               welcome, the Governor said, ' Mr. Cromwell, will you please to inform me which of
               these ladies is going to preach to the sailors ' W. C. replied by introducing us each
               by name. The old gent then offered me his arm, ^y. Cromwell took my companion, the
               others followed, and we proceeded through the beautiful grounds to the chapel. As w^e
               walked along, the Governor entered on a style of conversation altogether new to me.
               He made a polite apology for the freedom he used, and then proceeded to give me a
               little information about sailors, their characters, dispositions, tastes, &amp;c.,
               that I might the better know how to speak to them. ' You know, madam, that sailors
               cannot sit still like landsmen; they cannot keep their attention so long fixed, we
               are not used to very long sermons.' He requested me to say nothing to them about the
               abolition of slavery, and ' nothing about peace or war, unless I spoke in favour of
               the war, &amp;c.' After this, he looked as though he had a request that he hardly
               knew how to frame, and brought it out Avith, ' I beg your pardon, madam, but will you
               be so good as to let me look at your sermon 1 ' To this new and strange request, I
               replied by telling him something of Friends' views of the ministry, and that we do
               not prepare our sermons beforehand, &amp;c. He looked completely puzzled and somewhat
               alarmed as he replied, ' There are 470 men seated in the chapel waiting for you to
               preach to them, and you have not got your sermon ready ! You won't disappoint them,
               will you? ' He then proceeded to inform me that he had had some difficulty in getting
               the chapel for us, ' For,' said he, ' the chaplains, who usually officiate here, do
               not believe in women's preaching, but I pleaded hard, and they consented on condition
               that I should examine your sermon before- hand, and see whether it was suitable, and
               now you have not got it ready; will you please to tell me what you are going to say?
               Our chaplains cannot understand what a woman can have to say to all these men.' A
               little more in this new style of eldering I received from him, as to be so kind as to
               begin promptly and not sit still long, and to conclude in time to be at his house to
               dine at two o'clock. 'Mrs. Dupuyster wishes the honour of your company to dine; she
               is a very punctual lady and does not like her dinner arrangements disorganized,
               &amp;c.' By this time we had reached the chapel, and looking in, he whispered, 'There
               sit the two ministers, one Episcopalian, the other Presbyterian; I hope you will do
               the best you can, and let them see that a lady can do something!' With this he led me
               in, and up to my seat; in no wevj enviable state of mind did I feel. Sorely tried I
               was with all this unusual style of remark and counsel on my mind. No sooner had we
               gathered into silence, than the old man rose, and said, ' Mr. Cromwell, will you
               please to introduce the ladies to the audience? ' By the faltering voice and
               hesitating manner in which W. C. complied, I am inclined to believe he felt almost as
               ill at ease as I did. He just informed the audience that we had come from Michigan,
               stated the object of our journey and meetings, with a few remarks on Friends' mode of
               worship.</p>
            <p>"Two or three minutes only bad elapsed after he took his seat, when the governor
               leaned forward, looked earnestly at me, and beckoned with his hand, making signs that
               it was time to commence. I believe, although I have been in many a close and strait
               place, I never felt quite so much tried before any audience as upon this occasion,
               and, perhaps, never looked so earnestly for help in time of need, and to the honour
               of Him, who is a God, hearing and answering prayer, I may say I never felt strength
               in weakness and in a season of need to be more signally poured forth on me. Soon I
               felt raised above the fear of man; the two ministers and the governor were alike lost
               sight of, and a solemn sense of the importance of the salvation of the souls of those
               men, and my responsibility as I stood there before them, were the prevailing
               coverings of my spirit. The sailors listened with earnest attention and serious
               deportment. After a relieving opportunity in testimony, I felt constrained to bow the
               knee in prayer, commending us all to the God of all grace. With quiet order we
               dispersed, the governor again leading me out of the meeting, and towards his house.
               For a little while, the loquacious old gentleman was very quiet, then he broke out
               with the earnest ejaculation, ' God bless you ! what made you leave off so soon? ' I
               looked at him in surprise, for I was sensible that I had exceeded my time, and asked,
               * What time is it?' 'A quarter past two.' ' What will thy wife say about her dinner ?
               ' ' Oh, bless you, Mrs. Dupuyster was there, and we could have staid till midnight.'
               After some flattering and complimentary remarks, which I checked by trying to explain
               the nature of Friends' views of the ministry, he replied, ' Well, I don't understand
               Quaker doctrine, but I think the Quakers show their policy in appointing their women
               to preach, instead of their men. It seems to me, women can reach the hearts of these
               men in a way that the men never do.' After a little more in this strain, the old man
               turned suddenly to me, and said, ' But, madam, you made one great mistake in your
               sermon ! ' ' What was that? ' ' When you talk to the sailors about a steamer, you
               must never say " she set sail," you must say she got under ivay.''' There was not a
               sailor in the room but would know you were a landsman. If you had only told me,
               before, what yon were going to say, I would have set yon right.' I was somewhat
               relieved to find that my mistake was no more serions. As we were on our way to Staten
               Island, we had seen a steamer under way for San Francisco, her sails up, and her
               passengers crowding the deck. I had referred to this steamer in illustrating the
               brightness, yet uncertainty, of the voyage of life.</p>
            <p>"After partaking of a sumptuous dinner, and great kindness and courtesy, the Governor
               had his carriage brought to the door and took us to the school for sailors' children,
               where he sat and listened intently, as though he had been a child himself, while I
               spoke to the children for half or three-quarters of an hour. Then he took us for a
               pleasant drive through the de- lightful grounds and thence to the wharf. As we went
               through the grounds a beautiful, picturesque cottage, on rising ground, built in
               Gothic style, at- tracted my attention. A lovely flower garden, and many umbrageous
               and ornamental trees, and the water washing the foot^of the shrubbery looked very
               alluring. 1 exclaimed in delight, ' What a beautiful spot ! What a little paradise !
               ' ' Do you like it? ' he said; ' I am glad you do ! Well now, I'll make a bargain
               with you. If you will agree to come and live here, and preach two sermons a week to
               these men, I will deed you that place, and take care that you have enough to live on
               as long as you live!' 'But she has a husband and children at home,' said H.
               Underhill. 'Oh, has she?' he said, and then asked about them. 'The children are
               girls, all married but two.' 'Oh ! well, they'll soon marry off.' 'How about Mr.
               Comstock? Can he preach as well as you?' My replies to his enquiries seemed pretty
               satisfactory, for he replied, 'I wish you would write to the old gentleman and tell
               him he may as well leave off following the plough and come and take it easy for the
               rest of his life. I'll pay you well, and let those two chaplains go, they don't know
               how to get at the men's hearts.'</p>
            <p>"If I had written to my husband, and the elders of my meeting, and told them the
               liberal offer that had been made to me, I fear I should have met with no
               encouragement from them to accept it, and if I did, probably the two sermons would *
               come out missing.' The Governor gave a parting charge to William Cromwell to ' bring
               all the Quakers that came to the city out there to preach to his men, especially the
               women.' ' Do you know,' he said, ' we were very near refusing to let you have the
               chapel? If ever you go anywhere and are refused, do you begin to preach right away,
               and then they'll let you in ! '</p>
            <p>"Just as we reached the wharf and were about to part, the old man led me aside and
               made a beautiful request. ' I want an interest in your prayers. Pray that a poor old
               sailor, who has weathered many a storm, may cast anchor safely in the port of heaven
               at last.'"</p>

               <p>Baltimore, 22-8-6 S. "My Dear Friend, Eliz. L. Comstock,</p>
               <p>I AM writing some English letters to-night, but must send thee a few lines in
                  reply to thy acceptable letter.</p>
               <p>"I saw Uncle Lewin this p.m., and he was about as thou left him; thy messages of
                  love and sympathy w^ere very acceptable to him and the family. The beautiful lines
                  for Mary were left with Lewina for her.</p>
               <p>"I have very frequently thought of thee and thy work since we were together at
                  Blackwell's Island. I would much like to meet and unite with thee again before
                  thou finally leaves for thy home, but thou art among stronger and better people
                  w^ho can help thee, and I am engrossed as usual with many pressing duties and
                  cares.</p>
               <p>"Within the past month our city has felt the pressure of the war with renewed
                  force, on account of certain new business regulations, and we all feel discouraged
                  about matters and things in general. We have, I fear, a two years' war still
                  before us; the armistice, which the bad roads caused to be proclaimed, is nearly
                  over, and the rebels will move again upon our lines at Harper's Ferry or
                  Winchester. Twenty thousand men are landing to-day from fortress Monroe to be sent
                  forward to Rosencrans, in Tennessee. How my heart sickens at these evidences of
                  the war — oh, that they would cease the world over, and Christ's Kingdom reign
                  from sea to sea.</p>
               <p>"The Dr. occasionally exercises his gift to edification and comfort; still I feel
                  discouraged about our meeting — we are so weak and poor — such an outside pressure
                  of care and trial from this sad war with some valuable ones; and excitement and
                  interest absorbing the time and feelings of others — how weak and frail we are —
                  what creatures of sight and sense, instead of faith.</p>
               <p>"I hope that the Dr. will be instrumental in building us up. . . . As to myself, I
                  think I have some gift in putting others to work and helping them on — how I
                  should love to serve these dear friends or any others. Oh, that the work may go on
                  among us — I think there is a little more evidence among some of willingness.
                  Continue, my dear sister, to pray for us. often remember us before the throne of
                  grace.</p>
               <p>"I am glad thy minute was a comfort to thee — when thy work is over, may thou know
                  the sweet and full Sowings of that peace which is promised, even as a river. My
                  love to thee.</p>

               <p>One of E. L. C.'s sisters, writing from Rollin in December, 1863, gives the
                  following particulars of her Michigan home, &amp;c. : — " There is still a large
                  district of uncleared land (brother John T. Comstock's farm covers about eighty
                  acres); a very pleasant wood it is for us to ramble about in. I wish you could
                  have seen how beautiful the trees looked before they lost their leaves; the autumn
                  foliage is very varied and brilliant. A week or two since, we took a pleasant
                  drive to see the lakes a few miles from here. When brother John first emigrated
                  here, the beavers built in these waters, and the large bald eagles had their nests
                  in the trees that grew around; the wolves howled in the forest, the bears carried
                  off his hogs, and the wild deer devoured his grain. The Indians, too, were very
                  numerous then, but they are all gone, wild men and animals have been driven
                  further west. I have not seen a single Indian in Michigan, though there are some
                  in the northern part of the State. Most of the Friends here are farmers, they have
                  no tithe troubles, and, as they are their own landlords, rents are not very high.
                  We live chiefly on the products of the farm, but now and then get a little fresh
                  meat elsewhere. Brother John has a great many sheep, but he raises them for their
                  wool, and not for their mutton; we never eat mutton here; beef, pork, and chickens
                  are our chief animal food. We make our own coffee, that is, we roast red wheat in
                  the grain, grind it, and mix a little coffee essence with it; it is by no means a
                  despicable beverage when a good supply of rich cream is added, and of this we have
                  plenty. Tea is very costly now, partly owing to the war-tax, and partly to these
                  infamous privateer vessels. All articles of drapery are very high, common
                  unbleached calico that would have been 3d. a yard in England before the scarcity
                  of cotton, is now forty cents here, a sum nearly equal to 1/8 of our English
                  money. Silks, ribbons, &amp;c. are enormously high. . . . Labour commands a high
                  price, and it is very difficult to obtain help even at a high price. J. T. C. had
                  extreme difficulty in getting men this autumn, so many of the young men usually
                  employed in agriculture are in the army. Farm labourers are mow receiving about a
                  dollar (4/-) a day; in the busiest seasons of the year they can earn a dollar and
                  a half.</p>
               <p>"The war still continues, but the Confederates are getting pressed into narrower
                  space, and their resources a.re becoming exhausted. They have treated, and are
                  treating the Union prisoners very cruelly in not allow- ing them sufficient food.
                  Forty out of one hundred and eighty returned prisoners died of exhaustion within a
                  week of their release. Some Friends of this meeting, T. B. and wife, are now in
                  great trouble from the death of their son. He was taken prisoner after the battle
                  of Gettysburgh, and was then in robust health and not wounded. One of his fellow-
                  prisoners, who has just been liberated, writes to T. B. that his son ' was starved
                  to death in the Richmond prison,' and the lieutenant of the regiment, who was
                  likewise a prisoner, endorses the sad account. They do not mean that the rebel
                  authorities refused him all food, but the quantity supplied was insufficient, and
                  he pined away. In one respect I think it a good thing that the war has been thus
                  protracted — it has helped the cause of the negro. I am afraid the North might
                  have compromised the question of slavery if they had been able to subdue the South
                  too easily. Now there is no fear of this; the longer the war - continues the more
                  thorough abolitionists the Federals become. The Government at Washington has shown
                  every disposition to treat the Friends who refuse to fight leniently; in many
                  instances their penalties have been paid for them by some unknown benefactor. In
                  the State of Michigan most of those who have been drafted have just paid the fine
                  of 300 dollars rather than go, and it is not looked upon as a violation of their
                  peace principles, because the money thus paid goes into the general treasury. I
                  have not heard of a single Friend who has declined to hwj tea on account of the
                  war-tax (fifteen cents per lb.) imposed upon it, and there is not much difference
                  as far as principle is concerned in paying war-tax in one form or the other."</p>
               <p>In a letter to her sister (Eliza Wright), dated from Rollin, 8-12-63, E. L. C.
                  writes :— "Thy graphic and interesting description of the trip thou and E. enjoyed
                  in Ireland was very gratifying to me, as I had travelled on the very same ground,
                  stood at the foot of Powers- court Waterfall, and admired its feathery spray,
                  wandered through the Dargle, and spent near a month midst the romantic beauties of
                  Wicklow, Wexford, Waterford, and Dublin counties. In one of my Ackworth vacations,
                  my dear brother and I enjoyed this trip together. The Yale of Avoca we spent two
                  days in. Far different have been the scenes that have claimed my attention during
                  the past year. In a journey of 5,750 miles I have witnessed some beauties and
                  varieties in the scenes of nature, but far more has my attention been directed to
                  scenes of suffering, woe, anguish, degradation, vice, and misery, in the large
                  cities in this land. Most of the State prisons, peniten- tiaries, and many of the
                  county gaols, and city prisons in our Northern States (except New England) I have
                  seen, and many a tale of woe have I listened to, and endeavoured, as way has
                  opened before me, and as strength has been vouchsafed, to comfort the afflicted
                  and warn the careless. In Baltimore Penitentiary, I found amongst the convicts a
                  respectable, intelligent looking man under sentence for forty-five years. He has
                  served five years of his time. The charge for which he was committed was a breach
                  of the Fugitive-Slave Law. He had aided a family of fugitives to escape from
                  slavery. They were nine in family, they were recaptured and returned to their
                  cruel master, and he was sentenced to the State Prison, five years for each member
                  of the family, 9 x 5 = 45 years of rigorous imprisonment. He is between thirty and
                  forty years of age. Another convict greatly attracted my sympathy^ His offence
                  against the laws of his country was on this wise. One evening a sweet looking
                  mulatto girl, weary and footsore, hungry and forlorn, begged for food and shelter.
                  He could not refuse her, though he suspected she was a fugitive, and knew he was
                  breaking the law. He gave her supper, bed, and breakfast, and directed her
                  northwards. Before night she was returned to bondage, and he lodged in gaol. His
                  sentence was fifteen years. He poured out his tale of woe to me with many tears,
                  and told me that he had not been able ever since his imprisonment to converse with
                  a single sympathising friend. It seemed a great comfort to him to talk to me. It
                  is a blessed mission to visit the poor prisoners, and to know 'That mercy to the
                  bondman shown, It is mercy unto Him ' who may one day say ' Inasmuch as ye did it
                  unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye did it unto me.' The poor man was
                  in great affliction about his aged mother, his wife, and child. His mother, in her
                  eighty-seventh year, had been entirely dependent upon his exertions; he used to
                  keep a store in Baltimore, but since his imprisonment, the business had run down,
                  his home broken up, his mother had gone to live with a married daughter a few
                  miles from Philadelphia, his wife had to go out washing and charing to get her
                  daily bread, and his little girl was taken to an asylum. He begged me, ' for the
                  love of God,' to go and see his poor old mother. When in Philadelphia a few weeks
                  after, I went to visit her, a most touching time we had together, she wept, she
                  wrung her hands, smiled, poured out her gratitude at seeing anyone who had seen
                  her 'poor boy,' her 'dear Daniel.' She was too old and feeble, either to go and
                  see him, or to write to him, and I was the very first person she had met with who
                  had seen him since his imprisonment. Poor old woman, she complained of rheumatism,
                  the weather was cold, and she was very thinly clad. I told her she must dress
                  warmer, the tears came into her eyes as she told me that she was entirely
                  dependent upon the son- in-law she lived with, adding he is in poor health, and it
                  is as much as he can do to provide for his wife and large family. When I put five
                  dollars into her hand, (the means for this and other similar offerings being
                  provided by a wealthy Friend in Philadelphia) to get herself a warm winter dress,
                  she seemed as though she could hardly express her gratitude.</p>
               <p>"Another prisoner Avas sentenced fifteen years for having 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' in
                  his house!! He was a coloured man, a preacher amongst his own people. The
                  Baltimore Friends and some others exerted them-selves with the Governor of the
                  State, and got him liberated upon the condition that he would leave the State, and
                  never return to it. He had made himself obnoxious by being suspected of aiding
                  slaves to escape. The two former cases of prisoners, I have made known to F. T.
                  King, and he has stated them to those in authority. Francis T. King is a leading
                  and influential Friend in Baltimore, an intimate friend of the Governor of the
                  State of Maryland; and after considerable pains he writes me word that he hopes
                  these two prisoners will shortly be released, without serving their time. I
                  rejoice in this very much. I have met with so many interesting and spirit-stirring
                  cases in prisons, hospitals, and asylums, and a letter will contain so very small
                  a portion of it, that I believe I must give thee some statistics of it, and leave
                  the details. During the past year, I have travelled 5,750 miles, have visited and
                  had meetings with 52,850 sick and wounded soldiers, 17,100 prisoners, 16,060
                  inmates of almshouses, 520 blind, 1,125 widows, 3,250 insane, 5,450 orphans, 5,850
                  children in refuges and asylums, 1,987 poor fallen women, 6,900 coloured people; I
                  have had twelve meetings with Hicksite Friends, twenty-six with citizens in large
                  cities, two with young men, one with mothers, two with Christian ladies. With
                  children altogether, from the little ones in infant schools to the young aspirants
                  for collegiate honours, I have visited or had meetings with 26,500, many of them
                  in Sabbath schools and mission schools.</p>
               <p>During this long journey I have been favoured with unbroken health, and strength
                  equal to my day, though travelling through scenes of danger, and visiting
                  hospitals where great sickness raged. My visit to Nashville, Tennessee, was the
                  most exercising and most painful part of my service. Wickedness seemed to abound
                  in that city, immorality to a fearful extent, drunkenness, swearing, rebellion,
                  etc., infidelity, and scepticism. The accommodation in taverns and board-
                  ing-houses very inferior and exorbitant in charges. We (my companion and self)
                  took private lodgings- On entering our comfortless apartment, I sat down in a
                  rocking chair, being very weary; in a moment I found myself on the floor, one
                  rocker and part of one leg being gone, it lost its balance. I rose somewhat shaken
                  and bruised, and repaired to the bed, which was so rickety and dilapidated that I
                  feared I should again descend to the floor, but it did sustain my weight. While
                  lying there resting, I had leisure to take a survey of my room, and found the
                  result to be very unsatisfactory. Two windows minus the lower sash, which was
                  entirely gone, the upper sash being so thick with fiy-specks and dirt as to
                  require no blinds. There was one chair without a seat, one without a back; a
                  looking-glass frame without a particle of glass; chest of drawers minus one leg,
                  and no handles; no washing apparatus at all. I enquired for these, and was told we
                  could go downstairs to wash. However, upon being somewhat urged, they brought us a
                  cracked basin, and ewer without handle, a pitcher of hard water with no spout, and
                  rummer without stand, so that when not drinking we had to turn it down. Most
                  unpropitiously for my appetite, I got a peep into the kitchen. The family w^ere
                  waited on by five slaves. Seeing a poor black woman and two or three dirty
                  children standing by the door of a sort of outhouse I mistook for a stable, I went
                  to speak to them; in reply, the woman said, 'Bless you, I'm very well off, this is
                  the kitchen, and I'm the cook here.' She invited me in; a look, and the odour
                  arising from her domains, were sufficient to keep me outside; but the condition of
                  meat, milk, butter, eggs, fish, and onions, took away my appetite effectually
                  during my stay there. I could eat nothing but bread, and drank a little tea, which
                  tasted strongly of peach leaves. We were nearly two weeks in Nashville, and for
                  our board at this boarding-house, we had to j)ay two dollars per day each ! !</p>
               <p>"We visited every sick and wounded soldier in the city. Provisions are at an
                  enormous price. The city has changed owners three times since this terrible war
                  began. The whole had a very warlike appearance. Breastworks cast up in the
                  streets, fortifications and rifle-pits, arsenals, &amp;c., all around the city. As
                  navi- gation is closed on the Cumberland river during the summer, the only avenue
                  of communication with Rosencrans' army and the Northern States was by a single
                  line of railway from Louisville on the Ohio to Nashville, Tennessee, about 200
                  miles. There is one track only. The rebels are around it on all sides, and they
                  frequently waylay and pillage a train of horses, provisions, and army stores. This
                  is the cause of the high price of things in Nashville. The trains by which we
                  travelled to and fro were guarded by 100 soldiers in the cars, the martial music
                  sounding as we went along : a detached engine a few rods in advance of us passed
                  before us all the way, to see that the enemy had done no damage to bridges,
                  tunnels, &amp;c.; another engine within hail behind, all ready to hook on to the
                  passenger cars and mail, and return to Nashville or Louisville in case of danger
                  ahead. This precaution is taken continually, and is a source of great expense to
                  the Government. On our return from Nashville w^e came safely half way, and then
                  great alarm was excited, because the down train, which had been dtie near an hour,
                  had not arrived, and on trying the telegraph wires they would not work; they had
                  been cut. Earnest consultations were held, and then it was voted unsafe to
                  proceed, and decided to remain still until some scouts had scoured the country.
                  One hundred cavaliers were sent off with orders to search diligently for ten miles
                  ahead. After three hours delay they returned, reportiDg the coast clear so far. We
                  then moved on verj^ slowly and cautiously ten miles to the next depot. There we
                  waited while 100 cavaliers again were sent off. In less than an hour they
                  returned, reporting that the rebels had intercepted the down freight train,
                  pillaged it of 300 horses, war store of 'great value,' provisions, cloth- ing,
                  &amp;c., on their way from Murfreesboro' to General Rosencrans' head-quarters.
                  After robbing it of all they could carry off, they compelled the engineer and men
                  to leave it, and setting it on fire, started it alone at full speed on our track,
                  designing that it should meet our train and destroy it. This design was frustrated
                  through the watchful care of a kind Providence, and the prudence and patience of
                  the conductor and authorities, who delayed our train four or five hours, during
                  which the flaming train spent itself before we came upon it. It had come up within
                  three miles of this our second stopping place. The rebel raid had come out from
                  the fastnesses of the mountains in Kentucky, 300 in number. They were all dressed
                  in the Northern uniform, which they had pillaged from a former freight train. Our
                  govern- ment has had soldiers stationed all along this line of railway, not a mile
                  unguarded. But there are so many secessionists scattered about, residing in
                  Kentucky and Tennessee, that the Union troops are harassed and impeded in many
                  ways. It was with thankful hearts that we arrived in Louisville, Kentucky, at the
                  termin- ation of our perilous journey at midnight. The train was due at 5.30 p.m.
                  There was quite a sensation in Louisville; they feared that the rebels had taken
                  our train, and in the newspapers the following morning was a statement to that
                  effect, adding that the two Quaker missionary ladies, who had been so successfully
                  labouring, &amp;c., &amp;c., were expected to be in that train, and a hope
                  expressed that the rebels would not hurt us, and that we might do as much good to
                  them as we had done to the Union soldiers.</p>
               <p>"It is very pleasant to be at my dear comfortable home again, with my beloved
                  husband and child. But the sufferings I have witnessed and sympathized with are
                  almost continually present with me. I have truly known what it was to be baptized
                  into suffering, with a suffering people. I have slept in prisons, poorhouses, and
                  hospitals, and all kinds of accommodation 1 have had by night and by day; anything
                  that would facilitate my labours with the poor sufferers, I have submitted to. In
                  the prisons I have generally had liberty to visit from cell to cell, as well as
                  having meetings with them, and many an evening, after their day's hard labour was
                  ended, I have spent in going from cell to cell until ten o'clock; then occupied a
                  small room provided by the jailer, and at five o'clock the next morning I have
                  commenced again until their work hours, which are from six to six. Oft-times I
                  have been standing or walking about seven, eight, or nine hours per day, in
                  prisons, hospitals, and wretched huts."</p>
               <p>The following are specimens of the many letters she received from those in

                  other Hospital posts in the department of Ohio.</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen,— Mrs. Elizabeth L. Comstock, of the Society of Friends, is engaged in
                  visiting the hospitals of the army, for the purpose of administering religious
                  consolation and instruction to the sick and wounded. Her character and the value
                  of her services to the soldiers, entitle her to every courtesy and aid in her
                  labours, and you are respectfully requested to permit her to visit all hospitals
                  and convalescent camps, and to afford her the facilities for so doing," which may

               <p>"I listened to your address to our sick and wounded soldiers last evening with
                  profound interest, and I cannot forbear giving my testimony in favour of the noble

                  real United States Hospital may be thrown open to you, that our noble men in every

                  Assessor's Office — and to afford you as much pleasure as w^as my good fortune. I
                  introduce to your acquaintance Mrs. Elizabeth L. Comstock and Mrs. Sarah Smith,
                  both Ministers of the Society of Friends. They are also accompanied by James
                  Tayler, Esq., a very worthy and influential citizen of this city, and a member of
                  the same Society.</p>
               <p>"These ladies are visiting the sick and wounded in the various hospitals
                  throughout the county, and their mission thus far has proved a complete success.
                  Being a member of the Sanitary Commission, I ac- companied these good "Angels of
                  Mercy" in one of their visits to the hospitals here, and never witnessed closer
                  attention than that bestowed upon Mrs. Com- stock in her address to the
                  soldiers.</p>

               <p>"Mr. Tajder will ask for them the privilege of extending their visit to the City
                  Prison of Louisville, and, from your position, I have taken the liberty of asking
                  you to aid them in procuring the necessary pass.</p>

               <p>"This is to introduce to your kind attention Mrs. Elizabeth Comstock and Mrs.

               <p>"To the many testimonials which have elsewhere been given, of their zealous and
                  successful efforts in the direction above stated, it affords me great pleasure to
                  add mine, concerning their truly evangelical work here. As they leave for
                  Nashville to-morrow, and will be likely to visit Murfreesboro', I thought I would
                  take the liberty of giving them a letter to you, know- ing how deeply you are
                  interested in the same good work.</p>

               <p>Baltimore, 9-4-1864. "We were yesterday at Washington. I am not very fond of
                  sight-seeing, and returned excessively weary, and felt as though I should have
                  enjoyed the time better in the penitentiaries or hospitals, and should have spent
                  it to more purpose. I went just for the sake of L.'s company and to gratify her.
                  But there is something very trying to my nature in seeing the splendour,
                  extravagance, and waste in these large public buildings, while thousands are
                  suffering from want. One day I spent with the wretched inmates of the alleys and
                  lanes, and the next amid all the grandeur and superfluities that luxury can
                  invent. As I walk through the marble halls and see the statuary and fine
                  paintings, my heart turns to the poor outcasts in near sympathy, and more
                  fellow-feeling than with the ' silken sons of luxury ' in the palaces of ease and
                  splendour. I have now done with sight-seeing until thou and S. favour us with a
                  visit, and then, if you wish, I will step out of my element with you. I rejoice to
                  tell you that L. is going with me, down to York Town, Fortress Monroe, and
                  Norfolk, to visit the contrabands. I wish you could join us. This will be an event
                  in L.'s life. These coloured people seem likely to be a great people. The rapidity
                  with which they learn ^ not only literary acquirements, but farming, mechanism,
                  housekeeping, gardening, &amp;c., seems beyond all parallel in our race. There are
                  many thousands of them in these parts to which we go next week; perhaps we may see
                  10,000 of them. It seems, as though by magic, a change passes over our ladies and
                  gentlemen when they go to visit them. Ladies of refinement, delicately brought up,
                  gentlemen, professors of literature, go and visit them, and become so infatuated,
                  or so overpowered, or so wrought upon by Divine influence, they stay to teach
                  them. They seem capable of enduring hardships of all kinds, bearing discomforts,
                  wretched accommodation, hard fare, &amp;c., &amp;c., to instruct these poor
                  ignorants. I am so glad L. is going ! 0, how I wish it might shortly be said of
                  her, ' Is Saul also among the prophets? ' 'Is L. also among the missionaries? '
                  .... I wish you could come and see us and bring the children, when the war ends.
                  Do not come before that, for we have many hardships to bear, and heavy expense and
                  lack of labour, consequent upon the war. I hope thou wilt have a happy birthday,
                  and that thy happiness may increase with each returning anniversary.</p>
               <p>"We had a rich treat yesterday, listening to Charles Sumner in the Senate chamber,
                  but, as L. will, no doubt, tell you of it, and nothing is so tedious as a
                  'twice-told tale,' I will forbear. We heard a small portion of a speech from the
                  opposite side, Powell, of Kentucky, who thought that if Sumner's measure was
                  carried, it would bring 'eternal infamy' upon those who passed it. For this strong
                  language he was called to account by an earnest, warm, and eloquent, though brief,
                  appeal from Hale, of New Hampshire. Powell immediately made a pretty fair apology,
                  rather withdrawing the two opprobrious words, 'eternal infamy.'</p>
               <p>"The view of the landscape from the Capitol is very fine. The city of Washington
                  looks far better from this elevation than from a level, as the surface of the
                  ground is of a nature that perpetually inflicts upon the pedestrian the annoyance
                  of wading thro' an 'ocean of mud' or a 'desert of sand.'</p>
               <p>"But from the Capitol, on a clear day, the view is very fine. The city with its
                  spires and roofs sparkling in the sun, the avenues and streets straight, and
                  squares green and pleasant this time of the year, the Potomac, ' sparkling with
                  sunbeams, and dimpled with oars,' and, beyond the broad river (two miles wide
                  here), the Arlington heights, surmounted with the Union flag, the stars and
                  stripes, present a fair prospect to the beholder. Arlington, the home of General
                  Lee, has been confiscated by the Federal government."</p>
               <p>Her sister, who was with E. L. C, in Massachusetts, thus writes to a friend in
                  England: — "We spent a night at Newhaven (Yale College), where I was on classic
                  ground; it is a beautiful city, with the finest avenues of elms I ever saw. This
                  morning we are going to Boston that I may see Farwell Hall, hear the great organ,
                  and be introduced to the other lions of the place. Yesterday we went to Harvard,
                  Cambridge, and Mount Auburn — the last, as thou probably knows, is the cemetery
                  for Boston, and contains many very interesting memorials — amongst others those •
                  of Dr. Channing, Margaret Fuller Ossoli, J. F. Torry, Spurzheim, and Bowditch.
                  There are stones to the memory of Mr. and Mrs. Fuller (Margaret's father and
                  mother), and several other members of the family — above the monument erected to
                  Margaret F. 0. is a cross, beneath which is sculptured a portrait of her, with a
                  book and sword — then follows a long inscription to the memory of the three who
                  were lost in that sad shipwreck, * United in life by mutual love, labours and
                  trials, the merciful Father took them together, and in death they were not
                  divided.' The chapel is a beautiful granite building — within are four marble
                  statues, one by Story of his father, who was a very eminent lawyer, a judge in the
                  supreme court; one of Winthrop, the first Governor of Massachusetts, by Greenough;
                  one of John Adams; and one of Otis — these are all very beautiful pieces of of
                  sculpture.</p>
               <p>Providence, Sunday, Sept. 18--. — " We came here last evening and are now the
                  guests of Dr. Tobey, did thou see him and his wife when they were in England ?
                  They are very delightful people, they have two nice daughters residing with them,
                  and just now their son from the army is at home on furlough, he might retire from
                  the army if he liked but lie feels it Jiis duty to continue in it; he is evidently
                  a serious, thoughtful young man, he was at the battle of Fredericksburg, and it
                  was his company that was so fearfully exposed (for some hours after they had
                  expended all their ammuni- tion) to the fire of three batteries. Did I tell thee
                  of my dear sister's visit to Sybil Jones? She found her very much depressed as
                  might be expected, but still able to take comfort in the belief that all was well
                  with her son — the evidence, continually increasing, that reaches E. and S. Jones,
                  of their son's usefulness in the army, of his Christian influence there, cannot
                  but be gratifying. Thou would perhaps hear that the poor widow of Major Jones was
                  prematurely confined on hearing the terrible tidings of her husband's death; the
                  child lived a few days only. There was another child of nearly three years, the
                  darling of the household. He drooped after his father's death, and, without any
                  apparent cause, gradually sank away; just before he died, the child fixed his eyes
                  earnestly on one part of the room, and exclaimed, 'Papa,' then ' wait a minute for
                  me papa, I'm coming, and there's little sis too,' and so joyously' his young
                  spirit passed away to rejoin his father and baby sister in the spirit land.</p>
               <p>"Three p.m. The afternoon meeting begins at four o'clock, and my dear sister is
                  resting a little before it — while I sit beside her, I'm glad to have the
                  opportunity of adding to my letter. We had a grand day yesterday in Boston, we
                  went to Farwell Hall, 'the cradle of liberty,' spent an hour in the music hall,
                  listening to the grand organ, the second largest in the world. I enjoyed this very
                  much. Mendelsshon's ' Finale to the forty-second Psalm ' was very beautiful, and a
                  'slumber song' arranged for the organ was most exquisite — the low soft tones
                  might have sent us all into an entranced and ecstatic slumber if they had
                  continued a little longer — and we might have slept until the 'Hallelujah Chorus,'
                  which w^as grand indeed^ awoke us — in the afternoon, we went to the Athenaeum,
                  and saw the paintings, statuary, and libraries. We walked across Boston Common,
                  the scene so intimately connected with the War of Independence. America has its
                  hallowed spots as well as England. As I was walking under the beautiful elms on
                  Boston Common, it seemed strange to think that if all were well, in four weeks'
                  time, I should be walking about in Darlington.</p>

               <p>I am almost sorry I arranged to go before the presidential election comes off —
                  still it is very cheering to see how confident the New Englanders are of Lincoln's
                  success. The Yearly Meeting Boarding School is at Providence. My sister has a
                  meeting with the children this evening, but she is not going to visit any more
                  prisons, etc., while I remain. After I leave, Sarah F. Tobey (Dr. Tobey's wife)
                  accompanies Elizabeth to all the penal and pauper establishments. I am glad to
                  think E. will have so efficient a companion and co-labourer. We go to-morrow to
                  spend a few days with Susanna Howland, and then back to Lynn until I embark. C.
                  Coffin took me to Nahant on fifth day to show me the summer residences of
                  Longfellow, Prescott, Agassiz, and Fremont."</p>
               <p>E. Y. to E. L. C. 7-5-1864.</p>
               <p>"My Dear Friend, I have been wishing very much to answer thy kind and acceptable
                  letter, which was extremely interesting to us all, but each day has been so full
                  that I could not accomplish it. And now we are grieved to hear of thy being sick,
                  and are very desirous to know about thee. Thy work at Washington has proved very
                  arduous, and we fear thou hast overdone thyself; if thou canst not write thyself,
                  I hope we shall hear from thee through others; how well that thou got back among
                  such kind friends.</p>
               <p>"P. A. W., from New York, has been visiting some of the sick and afflicted, and is
                  still here, I believe. D. B. had large service at our Western Meeting, and would
                  be a very interesting and impressive minister if he did not scream so : he would
                  do for those who like to have the words ' driv ' into them.</p>
               <p>"We shall indeed long feel the loss of dear H. W. B. to our meeting, the most
                  disastrous which we could have sustained in the death of any one individual. Dr.
                  B. has been so upheld by a sense of the mercy and goodness which surround him, and
                  so taken out of himself by the contemplation of her gain, that for some time he
                  seemed sustained above grief; but latter 3' he told Charles he felt more cast
                  down, which is very natural. E. P. Gurney feels it very much, and Mary Whitall too
                  mourns — indeed all who knew her feel their loss. I have not seen the memoranda
                  taken during the last day and night, but her readiness and willingness to go were
                  very remark- able — no messages, no aiTangements, no anxieties about husband or
                  children, appeared to oppress her — the work was done, and her lamp trimmed, and
                  she 'went forth to meet the bridegroom,' ready to leave all, and enter into the
                  joys of heaven.</p>
               <p>"We are making our preparations to get into the country, and if it continues warm,
                  shall probably go week after next : we are hoping that thou wilt be able to spend
                  a few days at Netherwood as thou passes to New York — do try to do so.</p>
               <p>"It hardly does to think much of the impending events in Virginia : such a
                  momentous struggle, which let the result be as it may, must cause great loss of
                  life, is very solemn. I should like to have seen Burnside's army, yet could
                  scarcely bear it. We read thy letter to H. W. Scull, and are truly glad thou hast
                  traced the lost family of coloured people. We had an interesting exhibition of the
                  'Institute for Coloured Youth,' last fifth day evening, in one of the largest
                  halls in our city — it was crowded."</p>
               <p>E. Y. to L. R.</p>
               <p>Netherwood, 28-9-1864. "I was quite troubled, dear L., when I found A. had sealed
                  her letter to thee without sending a particular message of love from me, and feel
                  that I cannot allow thee to leave our country without again saying farewell, and
                  expressing my desire that thy voyage may be both safe and pleasant. We very often
                  think and speak of thee, and are very apt when anything of interest occurs, to
                  wish for thee; accordingly we should have liked thee to have been here yesterday
                  when our friend Julia Valentine and her nephew Colonel Fairlamb, recently released
                  from the Libby Prison, were here — he was discharged upon parole, with about
                  twenty others, chiefly it is supposed because they were deemed too seriously
                  wounded ever to take the field again. His story confirms the worst accounts of the
                  treatment our men have received from the rebels; he was four months in prison,
                  three in bed, and during that time had not a kind word spoken to him, so that when
                  he passed from the walls, the strangest thing he met with, was a kind voice and
                  words of sympathy — his wounds were skilfully treated, more so than usual, in
                  consequence of his being a doctor and able to direct and choose, and possibly from
                  some esprit de corps still alive even in a rebel heart.</p>

               <p>But it is wonderful that he survived the extreme reduction consequent, totally
                  deprived as he was of any stimulant or proper food. They had each about an eighth
                  of a pound of boiled meat (taken out of the soup) once a day, and a small piece of
                  bread — occasionally some wretched soup — and another piece of hard, dirty bread,
                  made of Indian corn and the cob ground with it, very productive of disease, in the
                  evening; hunger was at times almost intolerable, and they sold nearly everything
                  to obtain food, some parting with all their clothes to appease the painful longing
                  : Colonel Fairlamb sold his old boots for forty dollars, and came away in
                  slijjpers : but the dirt was almost as great an annoyance as the want of food —
                  his face was not washed for two months ! Imagine the discomfort and wretchedness
                  through which so many of our poor men struggle I He met with two or three persons
                  who had been prisoners in the North, who had the gratitude and candour to speak
                  warmly of the kind treatment they had met with — one saying, 'If Ave had known
                  what yoii unionists were, we would never have gone to fight you.' While he lay in
                  the ditch, into which he crept for safety, after being wounded, a rebel officer
                  came up and called out ' Who are you? ' ' You can see for yourself who I am '
                  (meaning his uniform told his rank as a U. S. officer). 'Where are you from'
                  'Pennsylvania.' 'Oh, I have been in Pennsylvania myself — after Gettysburg, and I
                  was never more kindly treated — you shall not be disturbed'; and he did protect
                  him from the j^iUcige which the wounded suffer, except that a General took his old
                  spurs — when the Colonel remarked, 'He was sorry his wardrobe was so reduced.'' T
                  believe the chief cause of his bearing so much trial was his unconquerable hope,
                  self-control, and the strength he had acquired by the exposure in the field; but I
                  must not tire thee with my details — I longed for thee to hear his recital that
                  thou may tell any Southern sympathisers in England what humane, generous people
                  they are upholding I hope thou hast been enjoying the beautiful environs of Boston
                  during this fine weather — we have had some most charming days — just now it is
                  rather too warm, reallj^ summer-like and ' our grass is as green and the flowers
                  blooming again, as if spring were here instead of autumn — still a red branch here
                  and there (like a few white hairs) betrays the advance of the season. Our love to
                  Elizabeth — I think the rest must be most welcome to her — tell her we shall be
                  glad to see her. We shall hope to receive from her all the particulars of thy
                  embarkation — she must expect many questions — she will please write in time when
                  we shall meet her — how pleasant if you were again coming together."</p>
               <p>C. Y. to L. R. 2S-9-1864.</p>
               <p>"Since thou left us, I have often felt that it was inhospitable in me to speak so
                  strongly as I sometimes did of what we call the wrong-doing of some of thy
                  countrymen toward us. Most truly do we appreciate the generous spirit in which
                  many Englishmen have written and spoken of our countrj\ Yet, was it quite without
                  reason that we were vexed when we found those on whom we most relied, those whom
                  your whole (modern) literature had told us were the highest types of man, were
                  seemingly united against us in this death struggle? We know better now, we know
                  that human nature is pretty much the same everywhere, that the highest excellence
                  is the product of Christianity as a power, not a profession; and that the true
                  type of what man was designed to be, is he who loves his neighbour as himself.
                  Many such men glorify your country; some are found here; and whether there or
                  here, they are bound by ties that nothing shall sever. Since thou left us, our
                  political atmosphere has cleared; I am told that there is little doubt that our
                  own noble State will place itself right, before the country, and that the defeat
                  of the ProrSlavery party, misnamed that of peace, but really that of oppression,
                  intermin- able war, anarchy, and barbarism, will be decisive.</p>
               <p>"Is it not a grand spectacle, the submission of the vast issues involved in this
                  election to iiyiiversal suffrage? Will not the ascendancy of the national party,
                  the party of permanent peace and freedom to all, under the pressure of war,
                  taxation, and intense domestic sorrow, prove that men may be fitted to govern
                  themselves, without a State Church, an aristoc- racy, or a monarchy?</p>
               <p>"I wish that intelligent men from all parties in Europe, men of half the sagacity
                  of De Tocqueville, and with the fourth of the magnanimity and clear- headedness of
                  Arnold (the father, not the son), could study the presidential elections on the
                  spot. There is much that is displeasing; much on the surface from which thoughtful
                  men turn with disgust; but when all the deductions are made for the passions which
                  are aroused, for the evil agencies which are called into action, for the vulgarity
                  and the coarse vituperation, which are the natural weapons of sordid and corrupt
                  men, it will be found that there is much in the free discussion (some think it
                  very bad English or even American) which informs and cultivates the minds of our
                  people, which even tends to infuse a true patriotism, and to elevate them above
                  their ordinary pursuits.</p>
               <p>"A great mistake made by foreigners results from the impression that our large
                  cities are the seats of power — New York is the centre of money operations,
                  Washington, the political capital, but neither in any sense the London, and much
                  less the Paris, of America. Our agricultural interest is really the depository of
                  power, and thou knows that every farmer in America, with very few exceptions, owns
                  the land which he tills. He may be very rude, he may be wholly ignorant of
                  conventionalities, and is too often sordid and preju- diced. But he is sagacious,
                  and, as a rule, honest, and a safer depositary of power, as we think, than the
                  aristocracy or the commercial class. I have read Goldwin Smith's letter with deep
                  interest and admira- tion of the man, and now I have only to add my earnest wishes
                  for thy comfortable and safe return to thy native land, and the sincere esteem
                  with which I am,</p>
               <p>"Thy attached friend,</p>
               <p>"C. Y."</p>

               <p>E. Y. to L. R. 14-11-1864.</p>
               <p>. . . "Before I say anything else, I must speak of our great delight in the result
                  of our election — so far beyond our hopes — out of the twenty-fiye States that
                  voted, only three have given a majority for McClellan, is it not a rare triumph
                  for free institutions and universal suffrage ! For several weeks before the
                  election, it was apparent that Lincoln would be re- elected, but we did not
                  venture to expect so decided and large a majority, which completely holds the
                  opponents in check, and gives the Administration great additional strength. There
                  is also two-thirds majority in the House, which is necessary to amend the
                  Constitution; so now w^e have only to hope that our future actions may be wisely
                  and cautiously directed, leaving nothing to regret. I think thou sees TJie Trihune
                  — did thou read the President's speech the evening he was serenaded, and did thou
                  not admire the noble Christian feeling and sound sense which pervaded it? And did
                  thou contrast it with Jeff. Davis' 'Message,' which in our paper was immediately
                  below it? The criticisms of the latter by ' the Richmond Whig' were very good,
                  showing the great inconsistency of offering freedom as a reivard, when slavery had
                  always been declared 'a divinely appointed condition for the highest good of the
                  slave'; as also of his determining to give them 'arms' without consulting the
                  States: does not the very suggestion of such a thing as arming their slaves show
                  their desperation? A friend of ours lately asked an intelligent coloured man what
                  he thought the slaves would do if they had arms given them — would they fight for
                  their masters? 'They will be very quiet until they get them.' ' Do they generally
                  understand our position?' 'As well as anyone. There is a telegraphic communication
                  throughout the South, and all the slaves know very well how matters stand.' Our
                  city was in a state of great excitement before the election, but no riot or
                  disturbance occurred except on the night of the demo- cratic procession, and now
                  all have settled down as quietly as if all were well pleased. But really I must
                  not fill my sheet with these details, which I daresay thou gathers from the
                  papers, but I could not but express a part of what has so engrossing an interest
                  to us, believing too, that the subject will not be tedious to thee.</p>
               <p>"Thou may probably have heard that the English Friends were not allowed to enter
                  the Southern lines, Jeff Davis refusing them permission after their cer- tificates
                  were sent to him. William Norton is now in Baltimore quite unwell, while Joseph
                  James Neave has gone to visit some of the meetings in Baltimore Yearly Meeting. We
                  have not yet seen them, but hear them well spoken of I am very glad my account of
                  Col. Fairlamb has answered so good a purpose — I only regret thou did not hear it
                  from his own lips, as a knowledge of his character w^ould have enhanced its value
                  — he is so averse to making a hero of himself, or in any way exaggerating his
                  sufferings. What will your Southern sympathizers say now? I shall like to see the
                  Times upon Lincoln's re-election.</p>

               <p>. . . Thou knows ere this that thy sister Elizabeth did not stop here on her way
                  south — we have not heard direct from her lately, but she has been in Washington,
                  and intends going to Norfolk in Virginia, before she comes to us. We forwarded
                  thj' letter to F. T. King, who knew her address, and no doubt sent it : we hope to
                  receive a letter from her soon. Has she told thee of her visit to the President ?
                  I often wished for thee on our bright, lovely, autumn days, when the woods look so
                  brilliant and dreamy. I was truly pleased thou saw so much of New England society
                  — thy description of M. C. is admirable. We have heard nothing of J. G. Whittier
                  since — some of his relations near Providence, wish him to spend the winter with
                  them, but we do not know how he will decide. . . . No, we have not seen the book
                  thou mentions by Conway. Charles says, ' tell her we now think of slavery so much
                  as a thing that is past, that we do not take quite so much interest in testimonies
                  about it, but they may be useful to some English folks.' But, in earnest^ we
                  should like to see it, supposing it must be good, if the Brights liked it so well.
                  With much dear love, I must say farewell, Emma C. Yarxall." </p>
               <p>Edith Griffith writes from Fayetta County, Brownsville, Pennsylvania, 5-6-64.
                  Beloved Friend, E. L. C, "It was indeed a sweet little intellectual feast to read
                  those interesting lines penned by thee among my own childhood's scenes, the first
                  received since our parting at Pittsburg. Thou hast often been a subject of
                  enquiry, and always one of deep interest. Thy self- sacrificing mission claims the
                  cordial co-operation and deep sympathy of all who are the friends of the blessed
                  Jesus, whose peculiar characteristic was ' going about doing good.' I sometimes
                  think and fear that the love and services of such are not duly appreciated, even
                  by the professed followers of the Lamb, that many amongst us, or bearing our name,
                  who seem to wish Avell to the cause, nevertheless, in every way, shrink from any
                  part of the burden. They cleave to their lands and their oxe7i^ their gold and
                  their silver, their wives and their children, leaving the Ark of the Testimony to
                  be borne about by the weaker sex. Is it any wonder that these should receive most
                  eminently of the heavenly anointing? and it is seen and known that the Lord has
                  made these strong for Himself, to go forth in the might of His power, to fight His
                  battles, to preach the unsearchable riches of Christ to the gathering of the
                  people, yea, even of the outcasts, and the conversion and salvation of their
                  immortal souls. Be of good cheer, my dear sister, and go on in the work of thy
                  day. Be not weary in well-doing, thou cannot serve a better Master, thou cannot
                  dedicate thy heart, time and talents to a better work than winning souls to
                  Christ. Oh, the mourning parents, bereaved widows, and fatherless children,
                  needing the consolations of the Gospel, whose ears are pained, whose souls are
                  sick, with the wrongs and cruelty of war and bloodshed, mourning their loved and
                  lost ones fallen on the battle- field; as well as the wounded, sick and suffering
                  ones, perishing for lack of care, and perchance for 'lack of knowledge.' There is
                  indeed work enough for us all in the great harvest field, and the day calls loudly
                  for faithful labourers I think as thou dost, that ive could work together in this
                  great strife for the promotion of the cause of the great Prince of Peace — but
                  thou art so much my junior in age, and so much my senior in courage and
                  magnanimitj' of soul, that I very much question my ability to keep way with thee
                  in thy untiring and assiduous labours up and down in the land, &amp;c.,

               </div>
               <div type="chapter">
                  <p>29-10-64, E. L. C. writes fro Washington, "Joseph Grinnell has just been to
                     visit the President (Abraham Lincohi) to make an arrangement for us to see him,
                     the time fixed upon for the interview being two p.m., to-morrow (First day).
                     Edward and Gulie Rowland, and Edward and Ann Earle,of Worcester, Massachusetts,
                     came as a delegation from the New England Yearly Meeting, on the Contra- band
                     question. They visited Lincoln two or three days ago, and as soon as he heard
                     E. and G. H. were from New Bedford, he enquired after Joseph Grinnell, and said
                     he had sat side by side with him in the House of Representatives, and had
                     visited him in his home in New Bedford, and when Edward H. told him of our
                     desire to call upon him, he said it would give him great pleasure to see us. I
                     must tell you something in connection with Jos. G.'s call upon our chief
                     Magistrate, too amusing to be omitted. There were a great many gentlemen and
                     ladies, alias men and women, waiting for an audience. Jos. G. went to Seward
                     (Secretary for War) first, and told him he would like to speak with Abraham
                     Lincoln a few minutes. Seward at once wrote a note to the President's private
                     secretary, begging, as a particular favour, that he would get an audience for
                     J. G. as soon as possible. He was then shown into a room, where forty or fifty
                     other special cases had been admitted, some of them of a sad, some of an
                     amusing character. After waiting an hour or more, the doors of the audience
                     chamber were thrown open, and the crowd passed in. Joseph Grinnell drew as near
                     as he could with propriety, and as soon as Lincoln saw him, he stretched out
                     his hand over the heads of some others, to shake hands with him. They were both
                     very tall men. While J. G. was waiting, he was a little amused with noticing
                     the objects and matters which had drawn others there. Two ladies had presented
                     themselves simply to procure the President's autograph. Two women, with many
                     tears and moving entreaties, pleaded for pardon for a deserter, who had been
                     three years in the service, and on the expiration of his time had returned
                     home. After awhile, he re-enlisted, received the bounty, and deserted. The
                     President enquired, 'What is his sentence ?' 'Imprisonment for some years,' was
                     the reply. Lincoln answered, with firmness but much gentleness, 'That is the
                     mildest form of punishment that can be awarded for such an offence. I should
                     soon have the army disorganised if I pardoned such.' They importuned, but he
                     was firm.</p>
                  <p>"A great rough man was the next. His business was to tell ' Uncle Abraham '
                     what he thought of him. He did not vote for him, he had been a democrat, but
                     now had changed his politics, was much pleased with what the President had
                     done, and meant to vote for him in future.</p>

                  <p>"Then followed a great many applicants for ofi&amp;ce. These pressed around him
                     and teazed him until he looked weary and almost worn out. Just imagine the
                     Qaeen of England so beset ! Now for the amusing scene. The previous day (not a
                     reception day) a stout lady had presented herself at the White House, and
                     insisted on seeing the President. She was informed that she ' could not see him
                     to-day, so she need not wait.' She replied that she must see him. The response
                     was, he was engaged Avith his Cabinet. ' I will wait until he has done with
                     them.' * He may be two hours.' 'Very well, if he is four or six hours, I must
                     wait, I cannot return home without seeing him.' As she was so very persevering
                     and importunate, and would not tell her business, they began to think it
                     possible she had some very important matter to intro- duce, and an intimation
                     was sent to the President to that effect. He smiled, and said to his Cabinet,
                     'Well, gentlemen, I do not see that we can do better than take a recess for
                     five minutes,' and the lady was admitted. She marched into the room quite
                     erect, right up to the President, without the least deference or any sense of
                     being in an august presence, and stretching out her hand to him said, ' Well
                     now, I've got what I have so long been desiring, a chance to shake hands with
                     you. I should have been quite ashamed to go home to my nine sons, and tell them
                     that I had been to Washington, and had not s^en old Uncle Abe.' The President,
                     with a hearty laugh, cordially shook hands with her, and sent a kind message to
                     her nine sons, with which she retired well pleased to return to Ohio, where her
                     home was."</p>
                  <p>"First-Day, 10th Month 30th . — I have just returned from visiting the
                     President. I was careful not to occupy much of his time, only twenty minutes
                     from the time he entered until we left the room. We were shown into a pleasant
                     parlour, nothing very stylish, no ceremony, but were requested to be seated, A
                     bright coal fire was burning in the grate, the sofas crimson velvet, the chairs
                     embroidered, or imitation of it, Brussels carpet, &amp;c. Over the whole, there
                     was more of an air of comfort than ostentation. It was much such a parlour as
                     any private family among the higher classes might enjoy. After waiting five
                     minutes, the President entered; we rose, he advanced and shook hands with
                     Joseph Grinnell, who introduced us, and he shook hands with us and courteously
                     bade us welcome, telling J. G. he was pleased to see him. 'Us' means Mary
                     Bradford and myself.</p>
                  <p>"In a few minutes we settled into solemn silence, and, without much delay, I
                     delivered my short message, which was somewhat to this effect, that the
                     language was his, ' Thou art my servant, I have chosen thee; fear thou not for
                     I am with thee,' see Isaiah, forty-first chapter, ninth and tenth verses;
                     alluding to the great work that the Lord was doing by his instrumentality,
                     referring to the proclamation of liberty to the captive, the opening of the
                     prison doors to them that are bound, the rod of the oppressor broken by his
                     means. I told him of my visits to the Contrabands, their earnest loyalty, and
                     fervent prayers for him, that the blessing of him that is ready to perish shall
                     not fall unheard, and that not only from this generation, but unborn millions
                     will yet rise up, and call him blessed. I referred to the earnest loyalty and
                     loving sympathy of a people (Society of Friends) in whose hearts he was
                     enshrined, our testimony against war, yet our loyalty, the univer- sality of
                     our devotion to the government, etc. My visits to the military hospitals, the
                     feelings of the soldiers, and the earnest ejaculations, 'God bless our noble
                     President ! ' that had often fallen upon my ears. A few words of sympathy with
                     him under his heavy load of care, ' Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and He shall
                     sus- tain thee'— the superintending care of a kind and tender Father. ' The
                     Lord reigneth ' — his supreme rule. ' Him that honoureth me, I will honour; and
                     he that despiseth me, shall be lightly esteemed.' The one way of salvation by
                     Jesus Christ, &amp;c. A season of prayer followed. The chief magistrate of this
                     vast Republic was on his knees beside us, bowed before ' the King eternal,
                     immortal, invisible.' I felt that very near access unto the mercy-seat was our
                     blessed privilege. When we rose from our knees, and were about to leave, the
                     President shook hands with me very cordially; he stood some minutes with my
                     hand grasped in both of his, and thanked me for my visit, and spoke something
                     to this effect, that he entirely agreed with me in my sense of the over-ruling
                     power and supremacy of our Heavenly Father. 'Perhaps there is no position like
                     mine, and no man living better able than myself to recognise the necessity of
                     Divine guidance, Divine grace, or to see the hand of the Lord in the great
                     events that are now transpiring. I appreciate your desires for me and I hope
                     that your prayers may be answered, &amp;c.' As he expressed his satisfaction in
                     our visit, we were about withdrawing when I asked for a flower from a stand on
                     the table, which he readily and cordially gave me liberty to take, and the
                     others the same."</p>
                  <p>Soon after this visit, E. L. C. wrote: — "I have just received a kind message
                     from President Lincoln and his wife. He was comforted and strengthened by my
                     visit, and she w^as greatly disappointed that sickness prevented her from being
                     present on the occasion. She was in bed all day.</p>
                  <p>"From the Executive Mansion, we went to a very different scene — straight to a
                     Contraband meeting, where John de Baptist, a full-blooded negro, quite a
                     character, was holding forth, in the style of their devotional and
                     demonstrative race, to a large, out-door audience, quite an acre of coloured
                     people, from a rude pulpit erected for the occasion. Just as my friends and I
                     approached, and took a seat placed in the suburbs of the congregation ' for de
                     white gentry,' from his elevated pulpit the preacher was introducing himself to
                     his audience as foUow^s, ' Bredren and sisters, you see before you John de
                     Baptist — my mother named me John de Baptist, 'coz she loved her Bible, and was
                     a great admirer of de 'postles. When I was in de land of Egypt, and de house of
                     bondage, I had to take de name my massa gib me, but now, tank God, I am de
                     Lor's free man, I take de name my mudder gib me; bredren and sisters, (with an
                     oratorical flourish) you see before you John de Baptist.'</p>

                  <p>"Here he broke off to give me the most extraor- dinary introduction I have ever
                     had to any audience, 'Bredren and sisters, dere is a lady come here who stands
                     in de occupation of a clergyman, and when I have finished my discourse, den she
                     Avill speak to you, and den, my dear bredren and sisters, I do spec we shall
                     hear something extry.'</p>
                  <p>"'Bredren and sisters, we will read a little from de blessed book.' He had a
                     large handsomely-bound Bible before him, the worse for wear, or rather the
                     worse for being handled by soiled fingers, of which he said, ' I borrowed dis
                     ere Bible from my massa, when I left de land of Egypt and de house of bondage,
                     as Moses commanded de Hebrews of old to borrow de gold and de silbur from dere
                     massas and missusses, and not to return dem.' He then proceeded, without
                     opening the book, to read as he said ' Dere was a certain rich man ' (Luke
                     xvi., 19 to 31), and went through a good part of the chapter, giving the sense
                     of it with very little variation from the original, except changing the
                     beautiful Anglo-Saxon for the negro lingo. He then charged his audience with
                     being great, big, wicked sinners. ' Bredren and sisters, you am, ebery one of
                     you, great, big, wicked sinners. You begin wid little bits of sins, like dat
                     (showing the tip end of his finger), and when you hab sinned ten, twenty, or
                     thirty days, your sins will grow as big as your fist. If you no repent den, it
                     will not take twenty or thirty days more for your sins to grow as big as dat,'
                     showing both fists. ' Den, in twenty or thirty days more, if you go on sinning,
                     your sins will grow as big as your heads,' giving his head a resounding clap,
                     suiting the action to the word. It gave a hollow sound, but he soon proved he
                     had plenty of brains there. His discourse was acconapanied by an immense amount
                     of action and flourishes, which would have delighted Dio Lewis, or any
                     professor of calisthenics, and made us fear that he would suddenly descend upon
                     the heads of his audience. ' And den, bredren and sisters, when your sins hab
                     grown as big as your heads, dey will tumble you down, down, down into hell-fire
                     ' (suiting the action to the word, and looking down with a horrified expression
                     of countenance, as he depicted the terrors to be found there), adding, '
                     Bredren and sisters, dem as lubs de swearing dey'll find plenty of sw^earing
                     down dere, and dem as lubsde cussing will find plenty of cussing down dere, and
                     dem as lubs de fighting will find plenty of fightin' down dere, and dem as lubs
                     de smokin' will find plenty of smoke down dere.' Here the whole congregation,
                     wrought up into a pitch of excitement, began to shake their heads, and make a
                     deprecatory motion with their hands, crying out, ' Dear Lord, not me, not me !
                     No-o-o-ho-o-o, not me ! Xo-o-o-ho-o-o, not me I ' creating a sort of prolonged
                     howl that went through the whole congregation.</p>
                  <p>"Then suddenly wiping his face with his hand- kerchief, and making it shine as
                     a negro's face will shine when in health, he looked up with a completely
                     altered expression of countenance. With a radiant face and an expression of
                     ecstacy, he said, ' But tanks be unto de blessed Lord, dere is w^ater; and it
                     is not a little, shallow, winding stream, dat you can only get into ancle deep,
                     but a great, big, mighty ocean, dat will wash away sins as big as your head.
                     Den de berry nex' day, after your sins am washed away, you begin to go up de
                     ladder dat Moses saw (meaning Jacob's ladder) dat reached from de earth to de
                     heaven. De nex' day, you will step on de first round of de ladder, and you will
                     leave off stealing, nex' day you will get up one round higher, and you will
                     leave off lyin', and de nex' day you will get on de tird round of de ladder,
                     and you will leave off drinkin', and de nex' day you will get on de fourth
                     round, and you will leave off beatin' your wives, den de nex' round, you will
                     leave off scoldin' your chil'en; ' and so he went on describing the gradual
                     work of sanctification, until on the upper round of the ladder, he said, 'And
                     den, bredren and sisters, when de golden gates is opened for some poor sinner
                     to go in, we shall see de glory, and hear de singin' and de music. It is not
                     like dose ole banjos dat we see down South, but it is de golden harps, bredren
                     and sisters; and de singin', it will be better than your'n, it will be like the
                     mightj^ thun- derin's; and den Ave shan't want any more of dese here filthy
                     rags, (taking hold of his garments) we shall be clothed in de yellow, and de
                     gold, and de orange, and de red, and de blue, and de green — all de colours of
                     de rainbow, bredren and sisters.' Then followed a lengthened and prolonged
                     shout of 'Glory! Halleluia.'</p>
                  <p>"Then heartily shaking hands all over the congre- gation, and pointing eagerly
                     upwards, and making signs to those he could not reach ' You and me,' ' You and
                     me,' he suddenly came down from his elevation, and his description of the
                     heavenly glories, with the announcement, ' And now, bredren and sisters, de
                     lady w^ho stands in de occupation of a clergyman, she will speak to you.' Which
                     I did for a short time.</p>
                  <p>"The same evening at half past seven, I had an appointed meeting in one of the
                     large and fashionable ■churches. The audience was of rather a higher class than
                     I commonly speak to. Some of the President's Cabinet were there. The house is
                     calculated to hold 1,500, but the minister said there were 1,800, or more,
                     there. When I looked on the vast assembly, I had a fear that my voice could not
                     reach them all, but there was such intense silence, and the building is so well
                     constructed for hearing, that the minister told me I was distinctlj^ heard in
                     every part of the house. Three other ministers have since invited me to use
                     their pulpits. So an open door is still before me. I cannot tell you how
                     greatly I have been helped and strengthened by our dear friend, Samuel Bettle.
                     I have had much of his company of late, and he has, both publicly and
                     privately, given me much encouragement in my work and mission. We had together
                     a very pleasant visit to Judge Bates, Attorney-General, one of the President's
                     Cabinet. We spent a most interesting evening with the Judge and his family, by
                     special invitation. We had a religious opportunity, and the Judge and his wife
                     seemed very much comforted thereby. They had been in much anxiety on account of
                     their son in the armj^, who has of late been exposed to much danger."</p>
                  <p>Third-day, 11th month 1st. — President Lincoln has been in great danger
                     recently. He was standing on the fort, four miles from this city, just taking a
                     survey, when suddenly an officer sprang on to the wall, and entreated him to
                     withdraw, as he was in imminent danger from the enemy, a skirmishing party
                     being very near. The President, thanking him for his care, had only time to
                     step aside, and see the brave officer shot dead at his side. This was told us
                     last evening by a personal friend of Abraham Lincoln's, and no account of it
                     was in the papers, it being thought best to keep it private."</p>
                  <p>A newspaper of the day thus describes the evening meeting on October 30th,
                     mentioned by E.L.C. in her letter: —</p>
                  <p>"Wesley Chapel was again crowded to its utmost capacity with a brilliant
                     assemblage (amongst whom we noticed Mrs. President Lincoln, Attorney-General
                     Bates and other prominent gentlemen of the depart- ment and of the army) to
                     hear a second discourse from the pious and eloquent minister of the Society of
                     Friends, Mrs. Elizabeth Comstock. . . At the close of the singing, she invited
                     the audience to unite with her in prayer. This address to the Supreme Being
                     consisted in heartfelt adoration and humble confession of our iniquities;
                     national, as having sinned against the African race, and the Indian tribes,
                     swearing, debauchery, scepticism, and infidelity; personal, as having neglected
                     God, and followed the devices of our wicked hearts. Then the condition of our
                     country was laid before the throne of heavenly grace, with the earnest petition
                     that the blessings of wisdom and divine favour might be poured upon our beloved
                     President, the members of his Cabinet, the judges, and all in authority. The
                     sick, ^vounded, and suffering in hospitals, were committed to the care of
                     Heaven, and their agonized and bereaved relatives in distant places were
                     affectionately remembered. The prayer was one of great eloquence,
                     appropriateness, and power. . . Every eye was now turned towards the lady
                     preacher, who advanced and announced her subject, the basis of which was the
                     text, ' For here we have no con- tinuing city, but we seek one to come.' The
                     exordium consisted of a vivid description of our own metropolitan city, with
                     its grandeur, and the skill and power of its inhabitants, which point she
                     improved, with an exhort- ation to our citizens especially, that it is not our
                     continuing city. The history of the nations of past ages was then reviewed, and
                     the dealings of the Most High towards them, with comments upon the words of
                     Holy Writ, ' Righteousness exalteth a nation, but sin is a reproach to any
                     people.'</p>
                  <p>"The preacher then glanced at our national great- ness, our churches, our
                     agriculture, our mechanical arts, and almost boundless prosperity. Then she
                     charged upon our land the sin of ingratitude in not acknowledging God in these
                     blessings. The wickedness which abounds in our large cities was also brought to
                     view, and deprecated. The Cross was then referred to as the sovereign remedy
                     for all our ills, national or personal; humiliation and repentance toward
                     Heaven the means of attaining the blessing of that Cross. . . Throughout the
                     whole discourse (fifty minutes in delivery) the lady enchained the vast
                     audience in perfect silence, her firm, clear, silvery voice being distinctly
                     heard in every part of the house."</p>
                  <p>Her labours among the wounded soldiers and the prisoners were fully appreciated
                     by the government authorities from the President downwards. In a letter dated
                     22-11-1864, Dr. Samuel Boyd Tobey, writing from Providence, says : — When we
                     visited the hospi- tal at Portsmouth Grove, the use of the chapel was refused
                     by the officer in command, on account of his prejudice against women's
                     preaching, and we visited the soldiers in different wards. When we left, E.
                     Comstock told them she thought she might see them again. A few days since I
                     received from the President a pass written by himself in the following words,
                     'Allow Friend Dr. Samuel Boyd Tobey and such ministering women as he may take
                     with him, to speak at the chapel at Portsmouth Grove Hospital to such soldiers
                     as may choose to hear. A LINCOLN.'</p>

                  <p>It was during this visit to Washington, that E.L.C. had an enter view with
                     Secretary Stanton. Her message was something to this effect : — " I stood m the
                     presence of the Secretar}^ of War, as an ambassador of the Prince of Peace. I
                     referred to the heavy burden he had resting upon him, and the arduous labours
                     and weariness; reminding him of the gracious and tender language of invitation,
                     ' Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you
                     rest'; referred to his great exertions for the Government, and unwearied
                     diligence in the service of his country, and my prayer- ful, earnest desire for
                     him that the same zeal and perseverance might be exercised in the service of
                     his God; that as a valiant soldier of the cross of Christ, he might stand. ' Be
                     thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.'"</p>

                  <p>In a letter to Dr. S. B. Tobey, E.L.C. writes :— "When I told Secretary Stanton
                     that his pass gave me more liberty than I required, for I did not expect so
                     extensively to visit the rebels and the soldiers, he replied, 'I hope the Lord
                     will send you there and bless your labours, for I am sure you will do them
                     good, and they need such ministrations.'"</p>
                  <p>Dr. Tobey, writing to E.L.C. on the 1-11-61, says, "In reviewing thy
                     experiences at Baltimore, it appears to us that our hearts should be filled
                     with gratitude, and our spirits raised in thanksgiving. He whose will thou
                     delights to do, whose thou art, and whom thou serves, in a very remarkable
                     manner in the 5th day meeting for worship made it manifest to all that He was
                     near thee, and that His injunction was 'touch not mine anointed, and do my
                     prophet no harm,' the Lord will continue to shield thee, and to prosper His
                     work in thy hands. Our hearts overflow in a continued stream of love towards
                     thee, and our prayers are poured forth abundantly for thee Let us keep as
                     nearly as possible to all the usages of our dear Society, in all our religious
                     engagements, for under its ^gis, I fully believe we can do more in the cause of
                     our adorable Saviour than we can without it. I do not say this supposing there
                     is any difference of views, between thee and me, my precious sister, on this
                     j^oint. My daughters with some other Friends have gone to-day again to
                     Portsmouth Grove. They are very much engaged in relieving the sufferings of
                     those now there, about 600 having been added from recent battles.</p>
                  <p>"Please to say to our dear M. that much as we value thy letters, we cannot
                     consent that thou shouldst appropriate hours that ought to be devoted to sleep
                     to write them. Thou must take care of the poor body. It is thy "positive duty
                     to do it. A single line from either of you, if it can tell you are well, is all
                     we ought to ask."</p>
                  <p>A few weeks later. Dr. Tobey writes, under date 27-12-64, "is a capital elder,
                     her remarks are instructive to me, and well worth reading. Are they not just
                     and true? I unite with her entirely as to our adhering to Quakerism. It opens a
                     door, especially to women, to labour in the Gospel, not to be found in any
                     other denomination of Christians. Thou knows this to be true from an abundant
                     and blessed experience, and I have no fear of thy leaving it. It is as precious
                     to thee as to or me, for I think William Penn rightly defined it 'a new
                     nickname for old Christianity.' I am rejoiced that Dr. M. has taken thee in
                     hand, and is giving thee sound, wholesome, sanitary lectures. Thou must not
                     offend against thy good Master by offending against the laws of health. It is
                     not for us to expect miraculous interpositions when we disregard what we have
                     already been taught. Don't disregard what I say. I am very serious in saying
                     it. Thou art, I think, constituted very much like Henry Kirk White — 'A soul of
                     fire in a tenement of straw.' Take care that the tenement be not consumed. I do
                     not for a moment tolerate the thought of thy going back to Annapolis. I presume
                     those prisoners are liberated, and if they are not, thou hast done what thou
                     couldst. Thou hast discharged thy whole duty towards them, so far as personal
                     effort can do anything, and if thou shouldst find that they are not set free,
                     w^rite one of thy touching appeals to Governor Bradford, but don't go back
                     again to Maryland. . . . And now, dear Mary, where art thou? Thou art very,
                     very precious to us. Lay fast hold of dear E. L. C, and don't let her go back
                     to Annapolis."</p>
                  <p>Under date 30-1-65, Dr. Tobey writes to E. L. C, "I saw E. R. to-day. He wished
                     me to convey his and his wife's love most affectionately to thee. Thou hast
                     left the sweetest possible impression on the citizens of Woonsocket; E. was
                     moved to tears in telling me about it. Thus the Lord established ' the work of
                     thy hands.' Let it be for thy comfort and encouragement. Thou art very close to
                     Him, and Jesus loves thee, and those that love Him^ love thee. Surely this is
                     all thou canst desire. Now let me caution thee not to overwork thy dear self in
                     Boston this week. Remember thou art yet in the body, and for us it is better
                     that thou shouldst long remain so. Let no one lay out exhausting labour for
                     thee. The Lord will tell thee all He wants thee to do. It is true I did propose
                     that thou shouldst hold a meeting at Woonsocket, but I thought the blessed
                     Master directed me to do so, and when thou asked Him, it was told thee to
                     attend to it, and art thou not fully convinced it was in His ordering? I
                     am."</p>

               <div type="chapter">
                  <p>AMONG the disadvantages of war, may be ranked the evils of a disbanded army, of
                     idle, dissolute soldiers, scattered abroad all over the land. Our Government,
                     forseeing this, tried to avert the evil in some measure by offering to every
                     soldier when the army was disbanded, 160 acres of wild land in the West, on
                     condition that he should go and live upon it, and work it. Among those who
                     accepted this offer were Harry Wilson and his comrade. After going out to
                     Kansas and pre-empting their land, these two young soldiers were returning to
                     New York, through Southern Illinois, a part of the country then almost in
                     Egy]3tian darkness, as regards law and order, judge and jury. They put up at a
                     third-rate tavern, and were playing cards and drinking in the bar room, when
                     they were arrested and committed to prison, upon a charge of burglary committed
                     three nights previously, the only witnesses against them being two men who
                     swore to their identity, and said they had seen them running away in the
                     moonlight ! The trial came on very soon after their arrest, or they might have
                     proved an alibi if they had had time to do so, or friends near to aid them.
                     They were sentenced for five years at Joliet, the State prison for Illinois.
                     There, six months later, I found Harry Wilson. After having a meeting with the
                     1,800 prisoners together one Sabbath morning, I obtained leave of the Warden,
                     General Dornblazer, to go round from cell to cell, to speak a few kind motherly
                     words to the young prisoners, and give them each a tract. As I did so, one
                     young man accosted me with " I think I have seen you before, is it not Mrs.
                     Comstock? " Upon my replying in the affirmative, he said, "I was in the Douglas
                     Hospital, at Washington, when you visited us, and you gave me a tract called '
                     The Fool's Pence.' " " Then," I said, " I fear thou hast not followed my
                     advice, or thou probably wouldst not be here." He replied by telling me his
                     name was Harrj' Wilson, and giving me the foregoing particulars of his arrest
                     and imprisonment. Upon my enquiring for his companion, he said he had written
                     to his father, who had made an appeal to the Governor of the State, proved an
                     alibi, and got him released, but, added the poor prisoner with great emotion, "
                     I had no father to plead for me, only a poor widowed mother in New York, in
                     feeble health, and I don't dare to write to her, it would break her heart to
                     know that her boy is in prison." My heart was deeply touched by his narrative,
                     and I assured him that he should not linger in prison for want of someone to
                     plead for him, that I would go myself to Springfield and see Governor Palmer,
                     if General Dornblazer and the Chaplain confirmed his story. Upon conferring
                     with these gentlemen, they assured me that Wilson's story was quite correct and
                     they believed him entirely innocent of the crime he was charged with, and
                     informed me there were three other prisoners in that Penitentiary equally
                     innocent, and requested me to present their cases also to the Governor. One
                     Avas a Avoman over seventy years of age, charged with child murder, whose
                     innocence was fully proved by the confession of the real murderer on her
                     death-bed, a year previously, yet this poor old woman still languished in
                     prison for want of someone to go and plead her cause w^ith the Chief Executive
                     of the State. She was a most pitiable object, her health had completely broken
                     down under the rigorous confinement, hard work, and harder fare. She had fallen
                     down on the smooth stone floor of the prison and broken her right arm, which
                     was bound in splints when I saw her.</p>
                  <p>Another was a man under middle age, very intelli- gent, sentenced for life, for
                     murder ; he was a Canadian, who, while travelling in Southern Illinois, walking
                     on the railway over a deep chasm, picked up a coat, hanging over one of the
                     sleepers; he carried the coat to a house at some little distance : there was a
                     considerable sum of money in the pocket, and he was arrested for murdering the
                     owner, who was found lying dead at the bottom of the chasm. He had offended the
                     prosecutor, the brother of the deceased, by urging in his own defence on the
                     trial, the dead man might have been intoxicated, and fallen off the railroad at
                     that dangerous pass. He had been five years in prison. Upon hearing of his
                     committal, a great friend of his, his pastor, had undertaken the long journey
                     from Canada to Springfield, Illinois, to plead his cause wath the Governor of
                     the State. The minister said he had known him from his boyhood up, and he had
                     borne an irreproachable character, and that all who knew him felt sure he was
                     innocent of the charge; his wife and four little children were in the deepest
                     distress. This plea on the part of the minister was unavailing, because of the
                     vindictive spirit evinced by the prosecutor, who opposed his being pardoned. By
                     the laws of Illinois (at that time) the Governor could not pardon if the
                     prosecutor objected. The warden and chaplain both spoke in the highest terms of
                     this prisoner, and were fully convinced of his innocence.</p>
                  <p>The third was a very honest, simple-looking, home-spun Kentuckian, charged with
                     horse-stealing — sentenced for ten years. He had been travelling in Southern
                     Illinois, when he fell in company with another man on horseback. After riding
                     together two or three days, he said, " the other gentleman, who was
                     well-dressed and very agreeable," offered *' to trade horses "; he did so, and
                     a few hours after they parted, was arrested for stealing the horse, which
                     doubtless the trader had stolen. No one, on conversing with this poor man,
                     could doubt his innocence of the theft, but being hundreds of miles from home,
                     with no one to plead for him, they concluded he had fallen a victim to the
                     sharp-witted horse-thief, with whom he had traded. Upon hearing these sad
                     details, my spirit was stirred within me, and I telegraphed to Governor Palmer,
                     to quer}^ when he would give me an interview, and requested a quarter of an
                     hour of his valuable time.</p>
                  <p>He replied by ready acquiescence in my proposal, and named a time, two o'clock
                     next Tuesday. I took the cars, and presented myself at the time appointed; a
                     mutual friend introduced me to him in the Executive Mansion at Springfield. I
                     briefly stated to him Harry Wilson's case ; he remembered liberating his
                     comrade, and expressed surprise and regret that no one had earlier spoken for
                     Wilson's release, as an alibi had been clearly proved for his companion, and
                     the two young men had been together.</p>
                  <p>Turning to the Secretary of State, the Governor directed him to write out a
                     pardon for young Wilson, which he would sign and seal, and give to me.</p>
                  <p>I then related to him the circumstances of the poor old woman, with the same
                     result. Then I proceeded to state the cases of the other two men, and was
                     interrupted by his exclamation, "Why, Mrs. Comstock, you surely don't mean
                     that- you want to open the prison doors for all the convicts at Joliet; I think
                     you may leave those two men to take care of themselves." " That is just what
                     they would like to do," I responded.</p>
                  <p>Then fearing that he was about to take leave, I urged the point with the words,
                     " Governor Palmer, the prerogative of mercy is vested in thee; it is a blessed
                     prerogative, and a time is coming when thou and all of us may have to ci-y for
                     mercy, I hope that in that solemn hour thou wilt be able to think of the words
                     of our Lord, ' Blessed are the merciftil, for they shall obtain mercy,' with
                     joy, and not with fear," to which he replied, " It is indeed a blessed
                     prerogative, but don't you see, Mrs. Comstock, that if I pardon all for whom an
                     appeal is made, without any opportunity for investigation, there will be an end
                     to all law and order, and anarchy and confusion will be the result." Then,
                     seeing I was still disposed to plead for these two men, he added, " I have no
                     time to examine into their cases, my time is expired," and he offered his hand
                     to bid me good-bye. In parting, I thanked him cordially for what he had done,
                     and said, " My time is precious, but I will remain in Springfield until thou
                     hast time to investigate these two cases, as I feel very sure that thou wilt
                     not suffer these two innocent men longer to languish in prison upon false
                     charges." Then, leaving with him, for examination, the papers that had been
                     given me by the prison Warden, I took leave. On the following morning, I
                     received from him all four pardons duly signed and sealed, also a note to the
                     conductor of the train, requesting him to show me the same courtesy that he
                     (the Governor) always received, and set me down at the prison gates, instead of
                     taking me to the station, two miles beyond, from which I should have had to
                     walk the same distance back, after dark. The conductor complied with this
                     request, slackening speed as we neared the prison gates, and then set me down,
                     with a hearty " God bless you and prosper you in your work." The stopping of
                     the train there brought some of the officials out in a hurry, to see if the
                     Governor had arrived, as that was usually the only occasion for their pulling
                     up before they reached the station. A cordial welcome, bright fire, and good
                     supper awaited me on entering the Warden's parlour, to the last of which they
                     were about to sit down, and General Dornblazer, with a warm shake of the hand,
                     said, " I need not ask you how you have succeeded, for I see it in your face."
                     "I have obtained a pardon for all four of the prisoners," was my reply, "and I
                     would like to see Harry Wilson."</p>
                  <p>The General persuaded me it was best to sit down to supper first, as Harry
                     Wilson could not leave the prison to-night; after supper he w'as summoned. A
                     look of apprehension passed over his face as he crossed the hall, as the
                     prisoners w^ere rarely sent for by the Warden, except for reprimand or
                     impending punish- ment, and it was a great comfort to me to see the rapid
                     transition from fear to joy, when his eye rested on my countenance. I shook
                     hands with him and queried, " What boon wouldst thou most desire? if I had the
                     power to grant it." "To go and see my dear mother in New York City," w^as his
                     prompt reply. "Thou mayst go," I said, "to-morrow." He cast a look of enquiry
                     tow^ard the Warden, who stood beside me, as if he could scarcely realize the
                     good news. " It's all right, Wilson," said the Warden, " Mrs. Comstock has been
                     to see Governor Palmer, and obtained your pardon." The young soldier
                     immediately fell on his knees, and gave thanks to God, in a w^onderful
                     outpouring of a grateful heart. As I handed him the papers containing his
                     pardon, he grasped my hand, covered it w^ith tears and kisses, saying, " I
                     shall pray for you everj' night as long as I live." Ere he left for the night I
                     said to him, " Harry, I am not accustomed to travel without an escort ;
                     to-morrow I expect to go to Chicago, and shall be glad of thy company." He
                     assured me how gladly he w^ould be my fellowMraveller; and accordingly on the
                     morrow we started, he having laid aside his convict suit, and was apparelled in
                     the identical soldier's cap and cloak which had caused his arrest. Seated side
                     by side in the railway-car, I persuaded him to sign the temperance pledge, and
                     gave him some earnest motherly counsel that henceforth he should avoid drinking
                     saloons and gaming houses, and such society as would lead to them, and seek the
                     companionship of Christian people, and regularly attend a place of worship. He
                     promised readily to accede to my wishes, and after expressing his earnest
                     gratitude for all I had done for him, said he had one more favour to ask of me.
                     " I think I have anticipated," I said, handing him a roll of bills, twenty-five
                     dollars, that some wealthy, benevolent people in Springfield, had given me for
                     him, to take him to his mother in New York. For a few minutes, he was too much
                     overwhelmed for expression, and then told me that was not what he was going to
                     ask for. While in prison for six months, he had learned a part of the
                     shoe-making business so thoroughly, that the foreman had told him he would now
                     be able to earn four dollars a day in a shoe factory, in Chicago, and he wanted
                     me to use my influence to get him employment, where he would not be known, and
                     pointed at, as a prison-bird. I stepped into one of the large shoe factories
                     with him, and asked the proprietor, " Do you want a hand? " introducing the
                     young soldier as one I had found ill in a hospital in Washington some time ago,
                     and been greatly interested in, and whom I thought they would find a steady,
                     skilful, and industrious hand. He took him into one of the workrooms, and
                     requested the foreman to test his powers. Wilson soon returned to me with a
                     smiling face, to tell me he was engaged at four dollars a day, and after a xerj
                     cordial leave-taking, we parted. I heard from him once, a year later, telling
                     me he had saved money, found his mother living and well, and removed with her
                     to Kansas. One little circumstance, which perhaps told in the young man's
                     favour, when introduced at the shoe factory, was this. The proprietor remarked,
                     "He has a good name," being the same as the very popular Yice-President of- the
                     United States, Henry Wilson.</p>
                  <p>We have been very much interested in visiting the different settlements of the
                     poor freedmen, and in hearing of them. Something in their mode of worship is
                     novel, striking, and ludicrous, though earnest devotion seems to pervade the
                     whole. In one of their Methodist Revival meetings at Alexandria, Virginia,
                     there was a great rough man, known by the cognomen of " Big Pete Jackson," who
                     was addicted to swearing, drinking, and fighting, and would sometimes stray
                     into their meetings and make a disturbance. A negro woman of almost colossal
                     frame, great vehemence, and earnest gesticulation, knelt to give thanks for the
                     many conversions they had had, and expressed herself as follows, " 0 dear Lord,
                     we tank you for de good work yoa is doing amongst us. We tank you dat you has
                     converted Tom, Dick, and Harry, and Jeff, and Mose, and Sam, and Andy. We tank
                     you dat you has converted Sail, and Moll, and Bess, and Dinah, and Chloe, and
                     Topsy, and Kate. But dear Lord, why don't you lay hold of and convert some of
                     dem great, big wicked sinners, den you'll bring glory to yourself.</p>

                  <p>Dere's great, big Pete Jackson, if you'll only reach out your big tongs of
                     Eternal Justice, and grab big Pete Jackson, and hold him ober de bottomless pit
                     of Hell, until he smells de smoke, and tastes de brimstone, and feels de flames
                     how hot dey is, and begins to squirm and squirm (but dear Lord, don't drop him
                     in, but hold him dere till you has converted him), den we will all cry 'glory,
                     glory hallelujah.' " She kept suiting the action to the word all along, with
                     earnest and violent gesticulations, until the audience almost felt as though we
                     could see the big tongs grab the man, and as though we witnessed his squirming,
                     and were doing the same ourselves. Poor Pete, who was in the house at the time,
                     was so wrought upon by this extraordinary prayer for him, that he elbowed his
                     way through the crowd, near a thousand being present, and threw himself down in
                     front of the altar, exclaiming in agony " Lord, help me ! 0 God, Save me from
                     the pains of hell " ! The whole scene was most striking to bystanders. I could
                     describe many equally strange, did time permit.</p>

               <div type="chapterSection">
                  <p>On the 22nd and 23rd of November, 1864, we visited the rebel camp at Elmira,
                     and found there about 7,810 prisoners in an enclosure of nearly fifty acres, in
                     the valley of the Chemung, surrounded by imposing hills. The buildings are
                     good, and so arranged as to give free circulation around them. We found their
                     rations only two ounces short of full army rations of bread, beef, and pork.
                     They also have beans, onions, cabbage, &amp;c., but mostly as soups. We believe
                     they are better provided than ever any prisoners of war were in the world.
                     Still there is never anything inviting about a prison. The confinement and want
                     of employment is evidently dispiriting; absence from home, want of sympathy,
                     and a harsh climate all combine, with the sameness of fare, to destroy the
                     appetite, hence a large per cent, look pale and somewhat emaciated. A quarter
                     of them are ailing. The surgeon separates about 1,500 under his charge. Some
                     are employed on the roads, and as carpenters, &amp;c., at five to ten cents a
                     day, and have full rations. They are all well clothed and have good shoes. The
                     hospital is in excellent order, and is provided with everything Elmira could
                     command for the sick. Pneumonia and diarrhoea are the prevailing diseases, and
                     some smallpox. They need more buildings — so many are sick that one-half are in
                     the common quarters, and lie two in a bunk. We spent an hour in their schools,
                     where they have had over 500scholars,but now, on account of the excitement
                     about exchange, there were only about sixty in. In the sick wards many enjoy
                     their Bibles, and love to hear of Jesus.</p>
                  <p>There are cases of Northern men, and even of slaves nearly white, and men not
                     of the army there, who should be released. You see there all classes of men,
                     and all shades of mental vigour and debility. On our way we met Dr. Hammond,
                     medical director for Western New York. His experience with the black soldiers
                     was very interesting to hear. He made what seems to be a very valuable
                     suggestion, that the coloured man needs different medical treatment from the
                     white man, and that a scientific commission should be appointed to report upon
                     the proper practice to be had in their diseases, and to study them
                     physiologically.</p>
                  <p>Of Colonel B. F. Tracy, the Commandant, we received every facility for our
                     service, also from Colonel More at the camp, and from Major Beall, the
                     executive officer in camp, we had all due civility. With the surgeon in charge.
                     Dr. Stocker, and with the steward, Lewis Babbitt, we were much pleased, as
                     being kind and very energetic officers. There seems to be a need of someone
                     whose duty it should be to arrange the patients as they grow worse or
                     better.</p>
                  <p>Suggested that Government employ a Commission to visit and investigate with
                     regard to the propriety of liberating such prisoners as may with safety be
                     released, many being drafted men — some foreigners, who had never borne arms
                     against Government — some maimed and disabled from ever bearing them again.</p>

                     had recently been taken prisoners. They were forced into the Rebel army from
                     North Carolina, and suffered very much; they w^ere taken by our forces. The
                     President gave an order to John Tatum for their release at once. They will be
                     sent up here; I shall send them to Philadelphia. How providential it was John
                     Tatum and his brother were there, and saw" these Friends with the Rebel

                  <p>"Having heard that the hospital at Winchester, Virginia, was very much
                     neglected, and sick and wounded soldiers suffering very much in consequence, I
                     felt an anxiety to go and visit them. General Sheridan had at that time an army
                     of 60,000 men, stationed along the hill-side, overlooking the Shenan- doah
                     Valley. Their encampment extended from the extreme right to the extreme left of
                     his army, twenty miles. Friends of Baltimore spoke rather discourag- ingly,
                     fearing the perils that would threaten us so near the front. But having a very
                     courageous companion, Mary Bradford, wife of William Bradford, the marine
                     artist, I was not discouraged by them, though they were afraid to send any of
                     their young men with us as escorts, lest they should be conscripted into the
                     Northern Army, or taken prisoners down south. Elizabeth Sharpless of
                     Philadelphia, formerly from Winchester, Virginia, being very desirious to
                     accompany us, we three unprotected women set out together. As the train drew
                     near Harper's Ferry, on the Baltimore and Ohio Railway, some officers seated
                     near us were talking of the dangers of the way. One of them said 'When we
                     approach the point of rocks, we shall be the hottest,' as the children say when
                     they play at Blind Man's Buff. 'If we pass the point without attack, we may get
                     through.' In reply to Mary Brad- ford's query about the danger, the officer
                     said that he had heard that Col, Mosby and his raiders were on the lookout for
                     the train, hoping to pillage it of the provisions, clothing and ammunition for
                     the army, with which it was heavily laden, and he told us we need not be
                     surprised if bullets came whizzing through the windows. This comforting
                     intelligence made us look out occasionally with some anxiety. We reached
                     Harper's Ferry in safety, and there our course was suddenly arrested by finding
                     a bridge burned down, and a tunnel blocked up. The train could proceed no
                     further, and we were informed that our only possibility of proceeding to
                     Winchester, would be by alighting and going on foot for a mile, part of which
                     we walked on sleepers, over a ravine of eighty feet, and one false step might
                     have precipitated us to the bottom. As I was hesitating and doubting whether I
                     could cross the chasm, a young soldier stepped up to me and said, *Why Auntie,
                     I am glad to see you,' offering to carry my carpet bag with one hand, while he
                     extended the other to guide me while crossing the dangerous pass.</p>
                  <p>"He was one whom I had visited and spoken to while lying ill, in a hospital in
                     Baltimore, some time before, His help was gladly accepted. After our dangerous
                     walk of one mile, taken with all possible speed, we just reached the train on
                     the other side in time to step on board, and without any further perils,
                     proceeded to Stephenson's Landing, five miles from Winchester, when the
                     conductor suddenly informed the passengers that he could take them no further
                     as the rails were torn up by the rebels. And now came a time of real danger. We
                     were landed, near sundown, five miles from our place of destination; as far as
                     the eye could reach, not a human habitation was visible except in ruins, or
                     damaged by the cannon, but camp- fires, horses, mules, baggage or army wagons,
                     tents and ambulances, and ammunition of war, &amp;c. A loud shout from the
                     railway officials bade us clear the track quickly, for fear of our dresses
                     being caught by the train about to back, and we had to jump down from the
                     railway embankment, about two feet, there not being room to stand safely there,
                     and alight ankle deep in mud and mire. It was the last month of the year; the
                     snow which had covered the earth a few days previously had all thawed; my
                     courageous companion, Mary B. Bradford, looked appalled for a minute or two, as
                     she saw the fierce, rough countenances of the thousands of soldiers so near the
                     front, who had for months been out of the reach of the civilizing influence of
                     mothers, wives, and sisters. But she was equal to the emergency. She put the
                     question repeatedly to one after another of the soldiers, as to the best way
                     for us to get to Winchester. Some were rough and some were rude, and one
                     catching hold of her carpet bag, said, ' I'll show you the way,' and started at
                     a full run; she saw that his object was to get the bag, and only recovered her
                     property by calling * Stop thief,' when he immediately dropped it. One of whom
                     she enquired, told her she must go into the mail tent, that it was their
                     business to take us. She summoned courage, and though the curtain was drawn,
                     raised it and stepped in. The officials there were busily engaged sorting the
                     letters. One of them immediately lifted the curtain, and turned her out, very
                     unceremoniously. She stepped back again at once, saying that we had a free pass
                     from President Lincoln, and documents from the Secretary of War, for General
                     Sherman. One of the officials answered very roughly, * We know nothing about
                     Lincoln or Stanton here, Sherid^in is boss, and he has given orders that no
                     woman should go to the front,' and again turned her out. Mary B. B. scolded and
                     lectured in vain; and then changing her tactics, tried the effect of smooth
                     words. Turning to one of the soldiers, who looked a little more civilized than
                     the rest, she remarked, ' It is pleasant to see one gentleman among so many
                     ruffians.' I have a very lively imagination, but yet found it difficult to
                     transform him into a gentleman; but he seemed both surprised and pleased with
                     the appellation, and at once volunteered his services to help her in any w^ay
                     he could. She stated our dilemma, and our wish to get on as quickly as possible
                     to Winchester, as it was impossible for three ladies to stay there all night.
                     He pointed to the news wagon, which was about to start for Winchester, saying,
                     *They will take you.' Mary B. B. stepped briskly round in front; the driver had
                     four horses in hand, and raising his whip was about to start them. Raising her
                     hands in front, she said, ' Stay a minute, stay a minute, stay a minute — I
                     have something important to say to you.' The man swore at her and ordered her
                     to clear the road, or he would run over her. She replied by a very earnest
                     appeal, telling him that we three ladies had come on purpose to visit the sick
                     and wounded soldiers, adding, 'If your mother and sister were here, you would
                     not suffer them to stay in a place like this all night.' Her appeal seemed to
                     be in vain, until Mary's ' gentleman,' coming up to the side, said he had
                     better be civil to us, as we were personal friends of Mr. Lincoln, and he might
                     lose his position, and persuaded him to take us. ' Bring your women then,
                     quick,' he said, ' and let's be off, I want to get to Winchester before the
                     letters.' There was considerable difficulty in climbing into the wagon — a
                     two-storey army ambulance, piled up with bales of newspapers — the two steps
                     both being broken off. I looked somewhat doubtfully, and queried, ' How am I to
                     get in ?' to which Mary's gent replied, as he took my carpet bag, and set it
                     down in the mire, ' You must set one foot on the hind spoke of the wheel, and
                     the other on the carpet bag, and swing round and spring on.' I still looked
                     somewhat doubtfully, when the driver, looking through the tunnel-like top,
                     growled out in a stormy voice, * Ladies as cannot climb, has got no business
                     here.' Though not much accustomed to swinging round and springing in, I
                     summoned up all my courage and dexterity, and, with the assistance of Mary's
                     gent, scrambled in. While I was doing so, Mary Bradford, in great dismay,
                     discovered that Elizabeth Sharpless was not with us. Elizabeth S. was a lady of
                     /great beauty, dignity, and grace, and, in her gentle tones, had asked one of
                     the soldiers to tell us the best way of getting to Winchester. ' Follow me,' he
                     said, 'and I'll tell you.' He started to a run, got into a waggon that was
                     moving, and she soon found that she could not keep up with him, or spring into
                     a moving vehicle — and we saw her in the distance, surrounded by hundreds of
                     mules and horses and baggage wagons. 'What's her name? ' said Mary's gent. '
                     Elizabeth Sharpless ' was the reply. 'Elizabeth Sharpless,' he shouted, ' pass
                     it on.' ' Elizabeth Sharpless, pass it on,' and a hundred voices echoed the
                     call. Mary's 'gent ' helped her through the living crowd of quadrupeds and
                     bipeds, and, with something of the gallantry of the Elizabethan age, held out
                     his hand for her to step upon, as he helped thus to raise her into the wagon.
                     Mary Bradford soon made her way in, but w^hen there our difficulties were by no
                     means ended. Seated on the top of the bales of paper, the tilted cover did not
                     allow room for us to sit upright, and the closely packed papers did not give
                     comfortable room for our feet, so that we sat in a cramped and uneasy position,
                     and had to hold on with all our might to prevent our being shot out in front or
                     tipped out behind, by the violent motion of the wagon, as the leaders, first
                     appearing as though going up a mountain, and then down out of sight, drew the
                     wagon with the right-hand wheel down into a deep mud-hole, and the left over a
                     boulder as big as a cannon ball. The parting words of Mary's ' gent ' had been,
                     ' Now you'll go like lightning,' and something like lightning it seemed,
                     indeed. Finally, amid pitch darkness, we reached the city of Winchester, where
                     the driver suddenly shouted 'Halt!' and we stopped with a violence almost
                     enough to throw us out. At the same instant, the driver called out, ' Out with
                     you, if you don't want to be pitched out.'</p>
                  <p>"Very quickly we alighted, having hard work to secure our things (bags and
                     umbrellas) and now we found ourselves in Egyptian darkness, in a city under
                     martial law — gas works destroyed, telegraph wires cut, and nearly all the
                     houses under the control of the army. We tried to make our way from the middle
                     of the road to a side-walk; whichever way we turned, we were ankle deep in
                     mire. Every now and then a moving torch or a lantern announced a soldier
                     approaching. In answer to the enquiry, 'Will you please tell us the way to
                     Aaron Griffith's?' soldier No. 1 replied ' Women here ! you are breaking the
                     law to be on the street after dark.' No. 2 said, with an oath, ' You'll be put
                     in the lock-up if you don't mind; you won't find very good accommodation
                     there.' No. 3 swore at us and declared that ' General Sheridan had given
                     positive orders for no women to come in the front.' No. 4 announced that we
                     should be run over by the rapidly approaching mail, if we didn't get out of the
                     road, for he heard the hoofs of the horses. No. 5, the first courteous voice,
                     said ' Aaron Griffith, Mr. Griffith, the Union man do you mean? Yes, I know
                     him, he is one of our best friends.' General Crook was the speaker, and calling
                     upon a couple of soldiers near by, he ordered them to carry the ladies' carpet
                     bags, while he carefully held his lantern, piloting us to Aaron Griffith's
                     door, which was very near. Aaron Griffith answered the knock at the door by
                     appearing in the hall in person, with a lamp in his hand, which he set down on
                     the table, and raising his hand, with a look of amazement, said, 'Elizabeth
                     Comstock ! is it possible thou hast made thy way here? I can't think how you
                     have found your way, except the Lord has brought you here.' To which Mary
                     Bradford replied, ' The Lord has brought us, and now we Avill thank Aaron
                     Griffith to let us in.'</p>
                  <p>"A most cordial welcome followed, and a delightful visit. With great sympathy
                     we heard our friends tell of the perils they had been in, and their great
                     sufiEer- ings through the war. For nine months they had not been able to make
                     their way to Baltimore to attend the meetings there, or to purchase groceries;
                     they had been stripped by the soldiers of all they had, and were living on army
                     rations, which had been supplied by General Sheridan, and without which they
                     must have starved, although an ancient and wealthy family. They had no resident
                     minister of our Society in those parts, and no Friend with certificate had been
                     there since the first month of the war, and then the meeting had been broken
                     up, and the Friends hurriedly dispersed by the rebels, before a word had been
                     spoken. They escaped with great danger, fleeing before General Lee's army. On
                     one occasion we went out six or seven miles from Winchester to visit Aaron
                     Griffith's father, whom we found in great afflic- tion because he had lost his
                     spectacles. The old man, over fourscore years, had borne the loss of crops,
                     horses, cattle, and produce of various kinds bravely, but a short time before
                     we were there, as he sat in his porch, reading the Bible, having left it a
                     minute, he returned in time to see his gold-framed spectacles carried off by
                     two Confederate soldiers, probably for the sake of the gold. The old man, who
                     had borne the loss of every- thing so heroically, shed tears over this, because
                     he could no longer have the comfort of reading his Bible.</p>
                  <p>"On our way to see old John Griffith we were very near falling into the hands
                     of the rebel raider, Colonel Mosby, and his clan. M. B. Bradford, who kept a
                     sharp look out for them, suddenly announced, ' Here they come,' and we saw with
                     some alarm, Colonel Mosby mounted at the head of his twenty-eight soldiers, in
                     Southern uniform, descending the hill in rapid pursuit of us, having seen in
                     the distance a carriage and horses, which would have been a great boon to them.
                     Aaron Griffith, who knew the locality w^ell and saw the danger, ordered the
                     coachman to turn round into a hollow, out of the public road, where we could
                     hide among the woods and rocks; and while in this position we heard Colonel
                     Mosby and his men ride past, seeking for us.</p>
                  <p>"Hatty Griffith, Aaron Griffith's daughter, was not BO fortunate as to escape
                     him. She rode out one after- noon to visit her grandfather, getting a boy, her
                     cousin, in the Quartermaster's department, to borrow a horse and buggy of one
                     of the officers and drive out with her. The brave girl was somewhat appalled
                     when the youth, trembling with fear, said, ' Here comes Colonel Mosby with his
                     raiders.' Hatty instantly took the reins, desiring the youth to sit back,
                     almost hidden by her and Colonel Mosby, coming swiftly down the hill upon them,
                     suddenly shouted ' Halt.'' He and his men came to a full stop, and she did the
                     same. The Colonel, coming on in advance of his men, enquired her name and where
                     she had been. Her ready and fearless answer was, ' My name is Hatty Grifiith,
                     and I have been to visit my grandfather, John Griffith.' 'Griffith ! Grifiith !
                     ' said Mosby, ' are you the daughter of Grifiith, the Union man? ' ' My name is
                     Hatty Grifiith. I am the daughter of Aaron Grifiith, and proud to say that I am
                     a Union girl.' He took the bridle rein of her horse to lead it out of the road.
                     She said, ' I would thank you to let me go home, for my mother will be very
                     anxious about me.' 'I dare say she will, but I have a little private business
                     to transact down here; and I do not wish any Union spectators to report me to
                     General Sheridan.' Leading her horse into a field near by, he told her that if
                     she would remain quietly there, not a hair of her head should be hurt, for he
                     honoured her bravery; but if she attempted to go away, he would not answer for
                     her life.</p>
                  <p>"Leaving her with four of his men to guard her, he went to transact his private
                     business, which was to rob a Union family near by. He then returned to her, led
                     the horse back again into the road, told her he hoped she would get home
                     safely, and find her mother well, and with a military salute, bade her good
                     night. It was nearly dark when she reached home, and found her mother in great
                     distress about her, who extended an earnest entreaty that she would not go out
                     so much, or stay out so late, and expressed her fear that she would see her
                     some clay brought home dead. She did not tell her mother the peril she had been
                     in, but just answered ' If I am shot, it will be by a stray bullet in the
                     house; you know there have been twelve bullets through the windows, three
                     through that door, and one is lodged in that table drawer.' The next day
                     General Crook called, and Hatty's secret of her encounter with Mosby could no
                     longer be kept from her mother; for in the presence of her parents, the General
                     said to her, ' Well, Miss Hatty, how do you like Colonel Mosby? ' ' How do I
                     like Colonel Mosby,' she answered, ' a pretty question for a Union General to
                     ask a Union girl, how she likes a rebel raider ! ' ' You need not pretend not
                     to understand me,' said the general, ' for I know that you were taken yesterday
                     by Colonel Mosby and his men, and I want to know how they treated you ;' and
                     then the whole story came out to her mother's great alarm. Although Aaron
                     Griffith had been a man of comparative wealth, he had lost nearly all his
                     property, one thing after another having been taken by the rebel army.</p>
                  <p>"It was near the end of the year when we arrived, and very cold; but there was
                     hardly any fuel in the house, all the wood and trees around had been taken.
                     Mary Bradford and I paid a visit to General Sheridan the other day (thou knows
                     he is in command of the army of the Shenandoah valley). We also went to the
                     front— what a sight it was ! As far as the eye could reach to our right and
                     left, on the brow of the hill, overlooking the beautiful quiet valley, Avere
                     tents, camp fires, horses, wagons, soldiers, etc., etc., such a sight as I
                     never could have imagined. For miles, no trees or fences were visible. I looked
                     and pondered — I thought of Israel in the wilderness. But as the cannons, the
                     guns, the bomb-shells met my eye, I could not say, ' How goodly are thy tents,
                     0 Jacob, and thy tabernacles, 0 Israel ! ' — I was rather inclined to mourn
                     over * the terror by night, the arrow that flieth by day, and the destruction
                     that wasteth at noonday.' As I surveyed the vast army— 50,000 — I was inclined
                     to query, ' where will these find bread in the wilderness.' For miles the
                     ground looked as hard trodden down as the street of a city.</p>
                  <p>"General Scott presented General Grant with a beautiful volume, on the fly-leaf
                     of which was written this nice little compliment, ' From the oldest to the
                     ablest General in the world.'"</p>

                  <p>Philadelphia, 2-1-1865. "I promised dear Elizabeth that, as she had not been
                     able to write to thee, I would try to give thee some account of her movements,
                     though I fear if I am not more clear than in my last note, thou wilt hardly
                     have thy curiosity satisfied: indeed, if I had not supposed that thou wast more
                     fully posted of all their doings up to the time of leaving for Winchester, I
                     should not have written as I did, but I hope thou gathered from my fragments
                     that the exposing and dangerous journey had been safely performed, though not
                     without incurring great fatigue, and a narrow escape from typhoid fever. I told
                     thee how exhausted dear E. was, and how she slept most of the day and night for
                     nearly a week, during which she had some fever each day, and a cough that
                     troubled her in the evening. We kept her very quiet, she saw very few, and
                     recovered her strength so nicely that she paid several visits the last few
                     days, though she still avoided being out in the evening. It was most happy that
                     she had??o icorh on her mind, and really could thoroughly enjoy the rest — not
                     at all too sick to be with us and entertain us, or indulge in reading some
                     agreeable book — so that the two weeks were, I do think, refreshing to her, and
                     the quiet just what she needed. I cannot tell thee hoAv very often we wished
                     for thee, nor how frequently thou wast our theme as we sat together Dear
                     Elizabeth left us last Fourth-day (28th), with Mary Bradford and Samuel Boyce
                     as escort, the latter having been to Washington, and returning just in time to
                     accompany them. I had a letter from E. this morning, telling of their safe
                     arrival at Xew York without her having increased her cold. Jos. Grinnell had
                     not yet joined them, but was expected that day, and arrangements had been made
                     for them to visit Sing-sing on First-day. She says, ' Give my dear love to
                     Lydia, and let her know I received her acceptable letter, through Dr. Tobey, on
                     my arrival here, and hope some time to reph' to it, but shall not be able just
                     yet. I have rested so long in Philadelphia, and am now about commencing active
                     service, and probably shall be doing all my strength is equal to at present.'
                     She expected to return to New York, and spend this week there, then go to Xew
                     Haven for a few days, thence to Providence for two weeks, and then to Boston
                     and Lynn for another fortnight, then cross the country to Vermont, thence
                     through Albany, Utica, &amp;c., to Union Springs, which she hopes to reach
                     during her C.'s vacation, but I doubt if she knows how long this programme will
                     take. I cannot but think her health is requiring care, and that she is not able
                     to do as much as formerly. Her cough, she says, is improving, but not quite
                     gone, and we are sorry she goes into those cold climates at this season.
                     However the cold there is constant, and the air generally drij^ so that perhaps
                     the exposure is not so great as in our frequent tliaivsy A. Y. adds to the
                     foregoing, " I must tell thee how very much I enjoyed thy sister's visit. Thou
                     knows I always did think her very lovely — but I never really knew her until
                     this visit when we had such nice talks. . . . . We had such a beautiful sermon
                     from her on Christmas Day, and a nice, pleasant Christmas."</p>
                  <p>C. Y. writes, "I should have been truly glad to have had thee with us a few
                     evenings since at a public meeting, called to give an expression of the public
                     sentiment against the iniquitous exclusion of coloured people from our street
                     cars. It was called by our prominent men, opened by prayer from Bishop Potter,
                     and addressed by some leading citizens, with great earnestness and effect. Two
                     coloured men were among the most effective speakers, one an Episcopal
                     clergyman, the other from South Carolina, a man of wealth, and highly finished
                     manners. He told us how he had been refused a passage many years ago, in one of
                     the packet lines to Liverpool, a certain Virginian of high family, having
                     objected to his presence in the cabin, and how, after paying his visit to
                     Europe, he sailed from Liverpool with the same person and his family, with
                     several other Southern gentlemen, w^as received as a South Carolina gentleman
                     of rank, danced with the daughter of the party who had caused his rejection on
                     the outer voyage, was feted and toasted, and finally, on his arrival in New
                     York, announced to the astonished company that he was a hlack man, or rather
                     had negro hlood in his veins, for he is really white — I do wish thou could
                     have heard him — he is such a thorough gentleman. The story has long been
                     current in private circles, but thou may imagine how effective it was, told
                     with tact and vivacity, and not a little evidence of high breeding. The result,
                     I doubt not, will be the speedy removal of the restriction."</p>
                  <p>A. Y. to L. R.</p>
                  <p>Philadelphia, Jan. 6th, 1865. "Miss Smiley who has been among the freed people
                     at Norfolk this winter, has just been paying us a short visit. She gives us
                     very interesting accounts of the poor things. Norfolk is a receiving depot, and
                     the runaways are continually coming in. The men are all employed by the
                     government, and most of the women find w^ork, so they are doing pretty well
                     there — now people are beginning to bestir themselves about Savannah. Miss S.
                     has told us some curious stories about the queer ways of the freed men, but
                     some of their sayings are very pretty. One old man of 105, when she asked what
                     he wanted most — he had just been begging for some 'baccy,' — answered
                     fervently 'I wants the grace of God most, missus,' and another poor old invalid
                     who was a great sufferer, said she was very happy, the Lord gave her so much
                     intrust. Miss S. says that their native politeness is wonderful, but no doubt
                     it is partly the result of the long servitude. She says she never asked even a
                     little child the way to any place, no matter how distant, without his insisting
                     on going with her to show her; and she has repeatedly seen coloured men leave
                     their work, unasked, to carry a little child across a crowded street. She has a
                     sewing school for the women, and a mothers' meeting; they learn astonishingly
                     fast to sew, even the field hands. She told us too the story of a prisoner who
                     escaped from a prison in Columbia S.C., which she heard from his own liiDS.
                     After he and his companions had got off from the prison, an old negro woman and
                     her daughter dragged a boat across the fields half a mile to the river, gave
                     them sweet potatoes, and rice, and directed them to other plantations. The
                     negroes hid them in the woods in the day-time, and at night they rowed down the
                     river, so at last, through the help of the slaves, they reached our gun-boats
                     at the river's mouth. There's a long rigmarole for thee, most of which thou may
                     very likely hear again from thy sister, whom Miss S. saw in New York a day or
                     two ago, or some of the New England Friends. Miss S. brought us good accounts
                     of thy sister; she seemed pretty well, and left yesterday for Providence and
                     Boston. After a meeting she had somewhere in New York the other day, where she
                     had spoken of good mothers who gave the Bible to their children, and of their
                     influence, a little boy came to her and said ' Mother died last week.' When she
                     asked him about his mother, he said in amazement, 'Why you know her, you spoke
                     of her just now — she gave me the Bible.' Poor little fellow! I wonder what
                     will become of him."</p>
                  <p>A.Y. to L.R. 26-2-1865. . . . . "And now I must tell thee of thy sister's
                     letter — she wrote from Union Springs, where she had gone with the Rowlands,
                     without going to Vermont at all. She expected to go home this last week, so I
                     hope now she is safely established there. She charged me to tell thee of an
                     adventure she had had in Rhode Island. She was speaking at a meeting held in
                     some small town of the Contrabands — Freed- men, I mean — and prisoners, and
                     sick soldiers; and noticed that one gentleman seemed much affected. He came and
                     spoke to her afterwards, and told her she should have prayed for the soldiers
                     in the army, and the success of our arms. The next morning, as she was going to
                     the depot, the same gentleman appeared, and asked her if she would like his
                     autograph. She laughed, and said 'yes,' so he handed her a cheque for 1,000
                     dollars for the Freedmen ! She tried to persuade him to give it to the
                     Committee of Friends in New England, but he refused, so she handed it to Edward
                     Howland, and they concltided to found a ' Harris Home ' — his name is Edward
                     Harris — in Washington, for poor coloured women, and afterwards this same man
                     sent 510 dollars more — isn't it remark- able? The deplorable assassination of
                     President Lincoln, which followed a few months after E.L.C.'s visit, and filled
                     all loyal Americans with consternation and grief, is referred to in the
                     following letters.</p>
                  <p>E.L.C. to L.R.</p>
                  <p>Rollin Lenawee Co., Michigan, 17-4-1865. In seasons when oppressive sorrow and
                     grief overwhelm us, we feel a longing for the society of those we love. Our
                     hearts seem to turn instinctively to those we love, and to those who love
                     us.</p>
                  <p>"Thus my spirit turned to thee on Seventh-day afternoon, when the appalling
                     news of the death of our noble President reached us. It was oar Monthly Meeting
                     day. Richard Harkness and wife, and several other Friends had dined with us.
                     John had business and went to Hudson in the afternoon; I was enter- taining our
                     visitors with a detailed account of my travels and visits, to sick and wounded
                     soldiers, contrabands, prisoners, and finally to the President, Secretary of
                     War, and others in Washington.</p>
                  <p>While thus engaged Wilber Ross called. 'What is the matter?' I enquired, as I
                     saw his countenance, expressive of horror. ' Have you heard the dreadful news?'
                     he asked, 'The most terrible that we have heard since the war commenced. The
                     President is shot by an assassin and Secretary Seward and his two sons
                     stabbed.'</p>
                  <p>"I was dumb with silence ! A solemnity pervaded our little circle, stillness
                     prevailed, until another, and then a third messenger called, each one
                     confirming the tragic story. I could not join in the conversation (of which
                     there was but little) until, in a season of solemn prayer and supplication, I
                     found some relief. Is it not dreadful ! Our beloved President, honoured and
                     revered as he was, slain by an assassin while surrounded by his friends and his
                     loyal subjects ! Anger, grief, indignation, everywhere prevail in this part of
                     the country. In Hudson, every house is draped in mourning. One man, on hearing
                     the dreadful news, replied, ' I fear that's too good to be true ! ' He was
                     instantly knocked down, received several severe blows, and narrowly escaped
                     with his life 26-4. Since writing the foregoing, I have been holding meetings
                     in Addison, Hudson, Adrian, and our meeting house here, endeavouring 'to
                     improve the sad event ' of the death of our noble President. This did not take
                     me more than one night from home, which I am much enjoying after all my
                     wanderings. John is well and happy. C. still at home."</p>
                  <p>E. C. Y. to L. R.</p>
                  <p>Philadelphia 18-4-65. "I am sure, my dear friend, that thou wilt feel with me
                     that words are entirely insufficient to give an adequate idea of the effects of
                     the shock we have received, of the thrill of anguish and horror which
                     penetrated our hearts, when the awful news reached us : — of the almost
                     overwhelming grief which the loss of our honoured and beloved President has
                     caused. . The sudden revulsion of feeling gave a deeper shade to the gloom;
                     since the fall of Richmond, so quickly followed by the surrender of Lee, our
                     city, and indeed the whole country, had been in a state of joyful excitement,
                     the streets crowded with all classes, showing their exhilaration in a variety
                     of ways — music, bells, whistles, day and night, hundreds of flags flying
                     proudly in the breeze, and every one of us rejoicing that our terrible war
                     seemed nearly ended; when, just at the moment of our highest triumph, the
                     dreadful blow fell upon us, and sorrow seized every heart, the tokens of
                     mourning have replaced those of joy, and the countenances of all show their
                     participation in this great calamity, which we almost thought would be
                     irreparable to our country. Indeed, we feel we have each lost a dear friend, a
                     father, one in whom we relied most confidingly, whom we trusted with the
                     certainty he would never betray our confidence, on whose upright- ness, purity,
                     and conscientiousness we might safely depend. His character grows on us
                     wonderfully, his entire simplicity in some sort hid his greatness, but now his
                     excellencies stand out boldly — his utter unselfishness, his true kindness of
                     heart, the total absence of allfmalice, revenge, evil thoughts, of all party
                     feeling, of one-sided motives — the great sagacity which enabled him to see the
                     right moment to act, the caution which held him back from too hasty a step, the
                     firmness which resisted every attack or persuasion, and the evident deep
                     religious feeling which influenced him, the settled conviction that he was but
                     an instrument in the Divine hand to work out purposes which he hardly saw or
                     understood — all now impress forcibly, and, while they enhance the value of our
                     loss, make us feel that for him death has but brought the peace and rest and
                     perfect happiness of Heaven. </p>

                  <p>It is an inexpressible comfort that he did not suffer — that no consciousness
                     of pain disturbed his last hours. There are, too, other causes for consolation
                     — such awful fiendish crime brings its own punishment — if there were any
                     influences which might induce a difference of sentiment in the Xortli they are
                     now forgotten, and all are more than ever united in one common effort to
                     sustain our country — our rulers — to for ever crush the sin which has been the
                     sole cause of all our suffering, the only fear being lest indignation should
                     carry us too far in visiting upon the whole South the crime of a few. They have
                     lost their hesi friend. Our estimation of our new President is constantly
                     increasing, though as yet but little has transpired to require much exposition
                     of his views : yet, as there is no change of Cabinet, and our late beloved
                     President had, in a very important meeting the day of his death, given his
                     plans for future action, we trust they will be regarded, and on the whole, not
                     varied. There is the strongest feeling to uphold Johnson, and not the least
                     depression about our entire triumph and final reconstruction, as a Union, not
                     again to be easily broken. It is impossible to think of anything else — the
                     horror has not passed away from our minds — the deep feeling of sorrow is yet
                     too strong. I cannot speak of our Y.M. which is now in session, nor dwell on
                     other topics, which at another time would occur to me I wish I could spend an
                     hour or tw^o with thee — there are so many things I want to tell thee, so many
                     details I could give of the great event which still fills our minds and
                     hearts.</p>

                  <p>"To-morrow evening the remains are to arrive here, and lie in Independence Hall
                     on First-day —the public having the privilege of passing in to see them. I
                     should not wish to view them in such a crowd; but if it had been possible to
                     have the privilege, as my friend S. F. Smiley had, of looking at him in the
                     quiet of his home, greatly should I have valued it. I had a letter from her
                     describing her visit in Washington, and thinking thou wouldst like to see it, I
                     have copied all relating to our dear President. I wish thou could see our city
                     with the signs of mourning — there is such universal, true, heartfelt sorrow.
                     On fourth day, all stores were shut, all houses barred — even Friends, who so
                     seldom give public demonstrations of either joy or sorrow, were participants in
                     this, so far as closed shutters, though we of course show-ed no draped flags.
                     The churches were open and the streets, during the noon hours, almost deserted
                     — in the afternoon the great thorough- fares were crowded with the lower
                     classes looking at the various mourning draperies, &amp;c., but all moving in a
                     quiet subdued manner — no boisterous talking, no confusion — it was very
                     impressive — such a different scene from the joyous one we had anticipated in
                     the great illumination we were to have had for Lee's surrender. A friend of
                     mine had a most touching account from Bishop Simpson (Methodist), of the last
                     day of our lamented President's life, which he had from Mrs. Lincoln herself,
                     when he visited her in her sick room, where she has been ever since the sad
                     tragedy. It was a remarkably happy day, beautifully clear, bright and lovely
                     externally, and wonderfully full of events. His son, the captain, breakfasted
                     with them, and gave many narrations of recent affairs in Richmond, which
                     greatly pleased his father — then a most satisfactory interview with Grant, and
                     afterwards with the whole Cabinet except Seward — a most impor- tant meeting,
                     in which he spoke of his future policy.</p>
                  <p>"After dinner he took a drive with his wife, who said he was so happy — he
                     spoke of his delight at the near approach of peace — his great satisfaction in
                     the unanimity of his Cabinet, and on the whole prospect before him as regarded
                     the country — she scarcely thought she had seen him so buoyant with pleasure
                     since he came to Washington. Was not his work done, and has he not passed away
                     at the moment of his greatest triumph, when his fame was at its zenith, and can
                     never now be dimmed! . . . .</p>
                  <p>"Three hours after the death of President Lincoln, his successor was
                     inaugurated without commotion — without any unnecessary ceremony — no confusion
                     anywhere; and all the people in the length and breadth of our land, move
                     quietly on with an increased confidence in their strength, and a firmer
                     determination to uphold their chief. I think every one, even the rebels
                     themselves, feel that the awful tragedy strengthens our cause. They regret it
                     sincerely, knowing the injury it must do them. His voice, who -always pleaded
                     for mercy and pardon, being silenced, they can but dread that justice and
                     judgment will take their places — we trust, not with any feelings of revenge,
                     though some fears are felt that our new Head may prove in some cases too
                     severe. But public confidence in him has increased, and we hope for good out of
                     all this terrible evil. 23rd. The body of our beloved President is lying in
                     Independence Hall, and from a very early hour this morning. Chestnut Street has
                     been crowded with people passing in to see him — no confusion — no loud words—
                     but with hushed, yet impatient feeling, each awaits his turn. Canst thou not
                     picture the scene in that old room where thou lingered one morning? His head
                     rests at the foot of the great bell whose motto is so appropriate ' Proclaim
                     liberty throughout the land to all the inhabitants thereof.' F. Y. tells me
                     that the carrying in of the bier through the long avenue by night, was most
                     solemn and imposing : while the wide walk was lighted with intense brilliancy,
                     all the rest was in darkness, and the hushed tread of the bearers, amid a
                     voiceless multitude, while he whom they so loved was borne past, was something
                     never to be forgotten. We can neither think nor speak of much else. S. Betile's
                     sermon was upon the same subject, and touched us much. Oh ! my dear friend, how
                     much we have lost ! Yet we do try not to lose sight of the mercy which has been
                     mingled with this awful stroke, and prevented the consummation of the horrible
                     crime at an earlier period : for certainly there was no time since he first was
                     chosen President, when his death would not have been far more disastrous — and
                     many crises when it might have been fatal to our cause. We tremble when we
                     think of the consequences which would probably have ensued if it had happened
                     before his last election !: And we strive to still trust the protecting hand of
                     our Almighty Father, who has so marvellonsly helped iis so far. Though I have
                     written so much, I have only showed the truth of my first sentence that words
                     are utterly inadequate to give ^jiist idea of all we feel — but thou wilt
                     supply what the poor words do not give, for I know thou wilt feel with us."</p>
                  <p>S. F. S. to E. C. Y. (extract referred to above).</p>
                  <p>"On 2nd day, the 17th of 4th month, the third day after the death of our
                     beloved President, I remem- bered hearing of Isaac Newton, and I gradually
                     recalled the fact that he was in the Agricultural Department, and that I
                     supposed^ w^as in the Patent Office — so I groped on, expecting to find that
                     closed, but no one questioned me at the door, and I walked in and found him at
                     last. Taking little notice of us at first, he went on to despatch some
                     important business, and then, taking his hat, said he would go now — that he
                     was about taking his wife and daughters and Sybil Jones to the White House, and
                     would take us also. It seemed like a dream, that a favour so untliought of, and
                     so unsought, should be given. Isaac Xewton was so well known to all. that the
                     mounted guards lowered their swords to let the Friends pass, where only a
                     chosen few could pass that day, and the physicians took not a little trouble to
                     arrange for our going up. "We waited half an hour in the East room, where the
                     preparations were going on rapidly for his lying in state. But the subdued and
                     noiseless manner of the workmen betokened a real feeling far beyond a mere
                     sense of propriety. Then we were ushered up to the room known as the Guest
                     Chamber.</p>

                  <p>"The memory of that scene I count one of the most precious possessions of my
                     life. I think none of us saiv him for some time. When I was able to lift my own
                     eyes it was to see the whole group in tears. There were in the room three
                     Generals (I think these were not his guard of honour) and a few other officers
                     of high rank, besides two physicians. I knew that those noble faces had so
                     lately borne unmoved the dreadful shock of battle, but they were not ashamed
                     now to Aveep as children for one they had loved as a father ; and when the
                     fresh gush of feeling was subdued, the settled sadness that remained gave an
                     indescribable dignity to those noble countenances, helping me to realize the
                     greatness of him around whom we stood. The face w^as very life-like, and I
                     could trace easily the expression of those qualities that made him what he was.
                     The lips w^ore a placid and benignant smile, yet mingled with the lines that
                     showed the firm purpose and power of self-restraint. The forehead was higher
                     than I had thought from his likeness, and when I passed to his head and glanced
                     down upon it its receding was less noticed, and there was a loftiness about it
                     which the rigidity of death touched with a something almost sublime. But the
                     associations, the thoughts called up in such a place, I cannot describe. There
                     we stood on the sad spot where the sorrow- ing hearts of a whole nation were
                     turning — no jostling crowd, no need of any sword to protect him now — and
                     there he lay, in his own house, as any of the people might lie, with only the
                     simple surroundings of daily life; no token at all of rank or grandeur about
                     liira — only the orange blossoms upon his pillow, betokening love : no token at
                     all of that awful tragedy visible : and then, that small strange group — half
                     of them the noblest and most valiant in the land, the rest, only simple, quiet
                     Quakers — and all in tears. But as I stood there, with thought after thought of
                     all he had been and all he had done, so simple, yet so great, I could almost
                     adopt the simple faith of that people whose deliverer he had been, that here
                     was a man ^vhom God had raised up as truly as he raised up Moses. Surely there
                     must have been some great and solemn purpose in the cotmsels of the Almighty,
                     when he suffered such a man to fall in such a w^ay and at such a time; whether
                     that purpose be one of mercy or wrath, who can now tell? Reason is perplexed,
                     judgment is blinded, and hope paralyzed, unquestioning faith alone looks to
                     God, and is not greatly moved.</p>
                  <p>"We went to the Capitol afterwards, so bright in the early beauty of Spring —
                     so sad with those dark folds of mourning. It was a strange day to see it for
                     the first time, and I felt no curiosity, no disappointment in not entering. But
                     it was a day above all others to feel the greatness of our country; the rich
                     blessing God had given us in so wise and good a government that staggered for a
                     moment at the suddenness of this great blow, and then moved calmly and stately
                     on."</p>

                     <p>for the ' Contrabands,' or coloured refugees as some prefer calling them. I

                        F. some little coloured boys in their school in Norfolk, Virginia, came to
                        the long word ' irrational ' in their lesson. Their teacher enquired if any
                        of them knew the meaning of the word. To her surprise, many hands were
                        raised. One little, bright-eyed fellow raised both hands, standing on
                        tip-toe, so sure he was that he knew. * Well, Charlie,' enquired the
                        teacher, 'what does "irrational" mean?' 'When you gets your rations, that's
                        " rational," when you doesn't get them, that's "irrational,"' replied the
                        little fellow promptly. . . .</p>
                     <p>"My last evening, on my late visit to Boston, was very pleasantly spent.
                        Ellen Johnson had previously informed me that Governor Andrew, Judge
                        Russell, William L. Garrison, and a few more, including Long- fellow, had
                        expressed an urgent desire to meet with me, or to have more of my company.
                        To this end she that you are doing so much in Darlington invited me to her
                        house, and, upon my consenting to go, she notified the above-named and many
                        more, and invited them to meet me. The company gathered about 7 p.m. A
                        lively, interesting conversation was carried on, standing mostly in groups.
                        There were about seventy in company. R. Collins, from New York, came, and
                        her daughter Anna . She and her daughters are going to England soon. M. and
                        R. Rowland, R. and S., who were visiting at New Bedford, and were about to
                        return home. Dr. and Sarah Tobey were invited, and came from Providence on
                        purpose. Harriet Beecher Stowe came from her home, but was too poorly to
                        join the evening party; she spent two hours with me in the morning, instead.
                        A very delightful time we had, Longfellow was detained at home by
                        indisposition. .</p>
                     <p>"At nine p.m., we were all invited upstairs to partake of an elegant repast.
                        Mine host handed me to the supper table, and then gave me over to Dr.
                        Tobey's care. On returning to the parlour, William L. Garrison, came and
                        took a seat opposite me — there were a few seats. He had been to visit the
                        President, and was greatly pleased with him. and told me all about his
                        visit. On his way, he had gone to the Baltimore Penitentiary, and wanted to
                        visit his old cell, where he was confined for nine months for aiding slaves
                        in escaping from slavery. He was refused admittance, and on stating this to
                        Abraham Lincoln, the President replied, ' Well sir, it seems to me that the
                        difference between 1816 and 1861 was just this — in 16 you were in and could
                        not get out, and in 61 you were out and could not get in.' ....</p>

                     <p>"The chaplain at Portsmouth Grove Hospital, was absent when we went; the
                        other officials, upon seeing President Lincoln's pass, were all civility,
                        and seemed to vie with each other in shewing us every possible attention and
                        kindness, and we had a good meeting in the chapel. After our return home.
                        Dr. Tobey received a most polite note from the Chaplain, expressive of great
                        concern that he had been absent at the time of our visit and his prayer that
                        the Divine blessing might rest upon the good meeting he heard we had had,
                        and upon the words of truth there spoken.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, dear L., I did feel parting with Dr. and Sarah Tobey, and their lovely
                        and loving family, very much. I hope we may meet again some day. They were
                        very kind to me, we had a delightful time together. Many pleasant seasons,
                        in the evenings we sometimes read, conversed, repeated poetry, and closed
                        with Bible reading and prayer.</p>
                     <p>"If we never meet with our beloved friends with whom we have mingled, and
                        from whom we have parted, here on earth, how sweet to look forward to
                        meeting and mingling with them in heaven. Some- times when I think of my
                        dear sisters and relatives in England, Canada, and Australia, and the
                        thought comes over me of the great distance that separates us, and that we
                        may never meet again upon the shores of time, I remember la the Christian's
                        home of glory, There remains a land of rest, There my Saviour's gone before

                     <p>"My Dear Friend, Our excellent mutual friend, Rebecca C. Kingsman, who has
                        been my guest during her attend- ance of the Quarterly Meeting, mentioned a
                        request of thine for the lines on the tombstone of Charles S. Torrey. I am
                        sorry that I have not a copy of them, and that my memorj' does not fully
                        recall them.</p>
                     <p>"We had a very satisfactory Quarterly Meeting, the attendance large, and the
                        weather uncommonly fine. I wish thou could have been with us. It was a
                        disappointment to me that thou wast unable to visit us when in New England,
                        but I suppose thy time and labour of love were better occupied
                        elsewhere.</p>
                     <p>"Is not thy heart full of thankfulness at the return of peace — -peace with
                        freedom? I stand, for my part, awe-struck before the wonderful revelations
                        of the Divine Providence ; and a sense of the infinite goodness which brings
                        good out of evil, and makes the wrath of man to praise Him, deeply impresses
                        me.</p>
                     <p>"I hope and believe that Friends will, in view of their merciful protection
                        during this terrible war, do all in their power to aid in the good work of
                        educating and caring for the freed people. It is a blessed privilege, not a
                        task; and we should do it joyfully, thanking God for the precious
                        opportunity. With much love and sympathy,</p>

                     <p>C. S Torrey, an intimate friend of Whittier's died in prison, having been
                        condemned for aiding fugitive slaves to escape.</p>
                     <p>A few years after this, E. L. C. was attending New England Yearly Meeting,
                        and met Whittier in a large party of Friends one evening. She was seated
                        next to him, and was giving a thrilling account of some of the fugitive
                        slaves, and of others whom she found imprisoned for helping them to escape
                        their cruel bondage, when Whittier suddenly rose and left the room.</p>
                     <p>He came to her next morning and apologised for doing so, saying that he had
                        felt so completely over- powered and unmanned in the remembrance of his
                        loved friend Charles S. Torrey, that he had gone alone to weep.</p>

                     <p>"My dear and honoured friend, "Elizabeth L. Comstock, " Thy capital and most
                        interesting and instructive letter of the 16th instant, addressed to Sarah
                        and myself, is received. It is most gratifying to us to be thus remembered
                        by thee. Our hearts leap with gladness when a letter comes to hand with thy
                        well-known superscription upon it (I don't know that I am using a proper
                        word, so I will say ' handwriting '). I like thy 'sermon' exceedingly, and
                        think thy inferences and comments on the seventh of Revelations just and
                        appropriate — I should like to preach just such a sermon from our gallery.
                        We were greatly delighted with thy vision of the family circle in our
                        library. Oh ! how we wish it could be realized, with the addition of one —
                        thy own honoured husband. I think as he loves thee, and thou loves us, that
                        he would love us too. Thou mayst be assured that we love him in advance of
                        knowing him. Thou judgest rightly that many and great have been our
                        afflictions during the past few months. The removal by death of many dear
                        friends (some of whom thou knew), with whom I have been wont for many years
                        to take sweet counsel, is severely felt. I greatly miss them : they have
                        gone to heaven, I long to meet them there, but desire to toil on here until
                        my day's work is finished. Oh I for more diligence in the discharge of duty,
                        more unreserved faithfulness in the service of the Lord. Thou art steadily
                        engaged in turning and winning souls to Jesus, thou tells them of a loving
                        Saviour, how sweet it is to serve Him, thou cites them to the joys of
                        heaven, and tells them how they may witness those joys their own by serving
                        Jesus, by loving Him who first loved them, who died and who lives to save
                        them. Blessed employment, glorious engagement, may the work of thy hands
                        continue to be established, and the peace which passeth all under- standing
                        be thine now and for ever. Amen.</p>
                     <p>I sincerely hope thy dear husband will go to Yearly Meeting with thee, I
                        love to hear of your labouring together, I wish I could encourage him to go.
                        I did not take my pen with any view of adequately acknow- ledging thy
                        letter. My dear wife will write soon. Every member of my household unites
                        with me in dear love to thee and thine.</p>

                     <p>"I cannot tell thee how glad we were to get thy most kind letter last
                        evening, and now I must send thee a line this very warm morning to tell thee
                        that we are all pretty well. My dear Doctor has rested a little, and seems
                        rather better, and I have faith to believe that if we can get to Saratoga in
                        a fortnight; he will be greatly improved by taking the waters, and by the
                        enjoyment of that perfect rest he gets there, and there only. I think he
                        will write thee a line with his own hand to-day. We are so very glad to hear
                        of thy good meetings in Boston and vicinity. Surely the Lord loves thee, of
                        this thou can never doubt. He who came not to call the righteous, but
                        sinners to repentance, and who ate with publicans and sinners, will bless
                        thee in thy work, and give thee souls for thy wages. I have often said in my
                        heart as I have seen thee performing the service. His will appoints, and in
                        a spirit of self- renouncing love, doing those things which were so
                        revolting to others, how Jesus must love her, and it is this love, with His
                        approving smile, that helps thee on in thy work of mercy and of love. I am
                        glad to hear that Mary Bradford is with thee, and that thou art going to New
                        Bedford for a little rest. Thou wilt find dear J. Grinnell's such a nice
                        place to stop a little and 'take in ballast,' as dear David Hunt once said.
                        Do give very, very much love to the dear good man, Joseph Grinnell, and his
                        beloved Rebecca, and accept a large portion for thy dear self from all our
                        household. We think thou had some flights of fancy ^ on thy way to Boston
                        the day thou left us.</p>
                     <p>Give my dear love please to Mary Bradford, and tell her I am glad to hear
                        that she is trying to be a good girl, and I feel sure she will succeed!! I
                        might have said in the right place, that C. and L. were greatly amused with
                        one portion of thy letter, but concluded thou had a clearer sense of
                        sinritual than temporal matters. Farewell, my dear, sweet, precious
                        friend.</p>

                     <p>Mackinaw Straits, Evergreen City Steamer, First-day, 29-7-1866. A few lines
                        from dear R. that met me in Detroit yesterday, told me of the serious loss
                        thou and dear S. had met with ... I am very sorry for you . . . and my
                        fervent prayer for you under this trial is that the Comforter may be very
                        near at hand, keeping and sustaining you, that through Him, this affliction
                        may be sanctified, this sorrow blessed. Perhaps through this your eyes may
                        be directed the more surely, in earnest living faith to those enduring
                        riches that shall never fade away, laid up for you, for ever, where moth and
                        rust do not corrupt, where thieves do not break through nor steal!' Peace be
                        with you ' in your trouble, under your privation and loss.</p>
                     <p>"You will wonder at the date of this. Here are John and I, on missionary
                        work, going to visit the islands in Green Bay. I have a minute from my
                        Monthly Meeting ' to visit in Gospel love the inhabi- tants of the islands
                        of Green Bay, consisting chiefly of poor fishermen and their families, also
                        the fishermen, Indians, and others on the shores of the lake in the vicinity
                        of Green Bay,' to proclaim unto them the glad tidings of salvation through a
                        crucified Saviour, and to distribute among them Bibles, testaments, tracts,
                        primers, detached portions of the Scriptures, and other reading matter. My
                        dear husband is my welcome and most suitable companion in this service.
                        Equipped with a good supply of the above-named books, with some large, warm
                        shawls and an air pillow, we took a steamer in Detroit for Washington
                        Harbour, Green Bay, via Lakes St. Clair, Huron, Mackinaw, and Lake Michigan.
                        Thus far we have proceeded with a clear sky and a calm sea, or rather lake.
                        We have been out of sight of land many times. This morning at four- forty we
                        put in at Mackinac Village, Mackinaw Straits, and tarried there four hours,
                        lading and unlading, while the passengers visited the romantic scenery on
                        the island. Among our fellow-passengers are B. F., of Cincinnati, his wife
                        and baby, his sister A. F., a missionary and his wife, who have been here
                        before (R. H. L.), from Cleveland, Ohio. We were very glad of their company
                        on this expedition. They are earnest Christians, very pleasant people, and
                        being acquainted here, are very useful to us, who are on new and untried
                        ground. B. F. comes partly as a missionary, partly to spend his summer
                        vacation ; his wife and sister for the benefit of their health, which is
                        poor.</p>
                     <p>"The scenery of Mackinaw Island is very wild and new to us. While the
                        steamer, which is a freight propeller, not designed for many passengers, was
                        detained at the wharf, J. and I and six or seven more set out on an
                        exploring expedition; we walked three miles to the Natural Bridge, a
                        beautiful arch, near 200 feet high. We came suddenly upon it, about 100 feet
                        from its base, and 100 from its summit, and had a very fine view. Looking
                        through it the landscape was most beautiful, the rich green, luxuriant
                        foliage on the left hand, the bright, clear, sparkling waters of the bay and
                        lake, seen through the arch, and also stretching far away, as far as the eye
                        could reach on the right, the precipitous crags and rough ragged rocks, the
                        wonder- ful arch itself, solid stone, just broad enough for a person to walk
                        across; the span, as near as we can judge, 80 or 90 feet. We are forcibly
                        reminded, as we stand and look at it, of Elihu Burritt's graphic description
                        of the Natural Bridge in Virginia — the addition of the water here adds to
                        its wonderful beauty. The arch is as well-formed, as complete, as though
                        chiselled out or planned by a mason or architect; a perfect arch in shape,
                        but of course there are asperities, projections and rough points.</p>
                     <p>"Second-day. We have reached Washington Island. The last two hours on board
                        it was very rough, and a qualmishness, the precursor of sea- sickness,
                        seized me, so that I was very glad to leave the boat and come ashore
                        here."</p>
                     <p>Rollin, 11th Mo. 4-66. " If ever I should be honoured with a mission to my
                        native land, it would be very delightful to have thee for my companion, but
                        I have no such prospect. . . . Here, in this land, is ample scope for my
                        energies and faculties, and here I feel in my very heart, while labouring in
                        the Lord's great harvest field, the sweet and gracious benediction, ' I will
                        bless thee and make thee a blessing.' Far more than silver and gold do I
                        value this, it is to me more precious than life. David Hunt, of Iowa, John
                        Henry Douglas, of Indiana, are about to embark for your land. I am well
                        acquainted with them both, and often we have laboured together in the same
                        meetings. We have felt very near and precious unity with each other. We all
                        rejoice in our work, we do endeavour, not by constraint but willingly, to
                        exercise our gifts. I wish I could just see them for an hour or two before
                        they embark, and send something by them to you, but that is out of the
                        question, they are 800 miles from us. They embark at New York, I believe. J.
                        H. D.'s companion, Murray Shipley, is a very interesting, pleasant man, an
                        earnest worker. J. and I were kindly entertained several days in his house,
                        when in Cincinnati." . . .</p>
                     <p>After attending New York and New England Yearly Meetings, having spent a few
                        days at Joseph Grinnell's, and visited at Dr. Tobey's home in Provi- dence,
                        Rhode Island, E. L. C. w^ent with her daughter to visit the State Prison at
                        Clinton. The latter writes,, " We went down Lake Champlain, between the
                        Green Mountains of Vermont and the Adirondacks of New York, to get to the
                        prison, where mamma was introduced to the inmates by the manager, as the *
                        Elizabeth Fry of America.' We stayed over First-day, and mamma visited the
                        prisoners from cell to cell. On my awaking in the morning, she said to me, '
                        C, Dr. Tobey has just been here.' 'Oh, no,' I replied, 'that cannot be, thou
                        must have been dreaming, for we are in Clinton, not in Providence.' 'I feel
                        sure I was awake, I saw him plainly, and he so earnestly encouraged me to go
                        on with my work, and ended with, " Be faithful, be diligent, the time is
                        short." ' I have often heard her relate the circumstances since. She wrote
                        that day to Dr. Tobey's wife, telling her the vision, and in reply was told
                        that, allowing for the difference in time and distance, it must have been
                        just the hour that Dr. T. died, and that he must have visited her on his way
                        to his home above."</p>
                     <p>From the account of a General Meeting of Friends, held in Grant County,
                        Indiana, 14-8-1867, the following extracts are taken: —</p>
                     <p>"Invocations went up for light — light from the Eternal Spirit, and this was
                        the key-note to the religious exercise of the morning. The opening prayer
                        was followed by E. L. Comstock in ministry, commencing with Barton's
                        beautiful hymn :</p>
                     <p>' Let there be light ! So spake thy Sovereign power. Forth burst the beams
                        of new created day, Applauding angels hailed the eventful hour, Enraptured
                        seraphs blessed the cheering ray.' . . . . The ritual worship of the Jews
                        under the old dispensation was sublimely grand, but the Christian's
                        adoration, in spirit and in truth, is still more surpassingly grand.
                        Solomon's temple crumbled to dust long centuries ago, but the temple of the
                        human heart, where this true worship is offered, shall endure to endless
                        ages! . . . . Eighteen hundred years ago, when Christ was taking leave of
                        his little band of followers, he gave the command ' Go ye into all the
                        world, and preach the Gospel to every creature.' As by the Evangelist, he
                        declared to the ancient churches that he beheld their works, or knew their
                        works, so he still knows what work the church is performing. It is not
                        necessary to be rich, or great, or learned, in order to labour successfully
                        for Christ. He has not in any age worked by these chiefly. Xo need for
                        anyone to say, ' If I had the eloquence of such an one, or the wealth of
                        another,' I would work. . . It is a blessed thing to work for Jesus. It has
                        been given to us to labour for Him. If He should ask the angels to come to
                        our world to instruct the ignorant, and to reclaim wanderers, methinks
                        multitudes would be ready. But this is not required of angels; it is my
                        work, and your work, the work of all God's obedient children.</p>
                     <p>"It is woman's peculiar business to labour for the reclamation of other
                        wandering sisters. The number of these is appalling. Twenty thousand in the
                        city of New York, twelve or thirteen thousand in Chicago, as many more in
                        Cincinnati; in Boston, ten thousand, and St. Louis contains still a larger
                        number in pro- portion to its population. Yet Christians and Christian
                        ministers hardly ever speak of this turbid stream of vice and shame. It is
                        producing disease and death all over the land. I have had intelligent
                        Christian physicians intreat me to help to reclaim these, in order to arrest
                        the stream of physical disease. How many of these poor creatures are ' more
                        sinned against than sinning?' I have known instances of daughters of
                        ministers of the Gospel falling through destitution, &amp;c." The young were
                        earnestly appealed to, to become workers in the cause. " Some you can
                        relieve — some you can take to your houses, and assist them to redeem
                        themselves, &amp;c. You can tell them they have a Friend, who can save them
                        to the uttermost. I wish I had a voice that could reach to the ends of the
                        lands, so that I might be instrumental in rescuing these erring ones.</p>
                     <p>"Emily, the beautiful and accomplished daughter of a wealthy family, was
                        taken ill. Her fond parents were filled with alarm, fearing that they might
                        lose their darling. A skilful physician Avas summoned. Days and nights of
                        anxious suspense and careful watching followed; then the skill of the doctor
                        and the careful nursing of the family were repaid by Emily's restoration to
                        health. A liberal fee paid to the physician testified the gratitude of the
                        parents. They felt that their precious child had been snatched from the very
                        jaws of death. A few weeks passed away, and this petted child of luxury
                        disappeared from the home of her childhood. Weeping and wailing, sorrow and
                        grief were there. They sought her but she could not be found, and a greater
                        alarm than they had ever known before — a denser darkness overshadowed the
                        once bright home, and settled upon the hearts of the stricken, bereaved
                        parents, as they mourned with un- availing anguish their lost child. And
                        where was Emily? The story is soon told. The young physician also had
                        disappeared. The young, impressible, un- suspecting heart of the girl of
                        fifteen had been won, and with promises of marriage, of a life of happiness,
                        of pleasure and of indulgence, she had been enticed from the loving,
                        trusting parents, from the bright, joyous home, from the innocent companions
                        of her girlhood, and led into sorrow, shame, and woe. Bitter disappointment
                        was her portion, as day after day the prospect of marriage was delayed, and
                        seemed more and more remote. The seducer tried to cheer his poor victim by
                        taking her to the theatre, the opera, the concert, by the wine-cup, by
                        change of scene, travel- ling, witnessing the beautiful variety of
                        landscape, resting in large hotels luxuriantly fitted up, and elegantly
                        furnished apartments. For a season, intoxi- cated by what the world calls
                        pleasure, reflection was drowned out, conscience was deadened, and the
                        better feelings seemed to sleep. After a few months of this indulgence there
                        came a bitter awakening — conscience would be heard — remorse was gnawing at
                        her heart. Her beauty was fading, her vivacity and sprightliness gone, her
                        attractiveness passing away, and finding her no longer able to minister to
                        his enjoyments, the cruel seducer deserted his heart-broken victim. Weak and
                        ill, she took refuge for awhile in a hospital, xlfter months of suffering,
                        strong enough, physically, to walk about, she was dismissed from this
                        refuge, yet not strong enough to battle with the world or to earn her own
                        living. Comfortless, lonely, she wandered homeless, seeking for occupation,
                        for the means of sustenance. Timidly she ventured to call on a 'Christian
                        lady,' and enquired for work. She was coldly repulsed — 'I do not want one
                        like you in my house, to associate with my daughters! ' A second effort was
                        made; the poor young heart was longing for sympathy, yearning for a home,
                        'What can you do?' was the query. She could not teach, and if she could,
                        they did not want one like her to teach their children. 'Could she sew?'
                        'make dresses?' 'understand millinery?' 'the sewing machine?' No! Alas! poor
                        child, there was no place for her there.</p>
                     <p>"'So she turned again to sin, What had she to lose or win.'</p>
                     <p>"After a few more months passed in the paths her soul loathed, she was again
                        deserted, and ill, suffering, destitute, took refuge in a hospital. Months
                        of physical prostration and acute pain succeeded; then, thrown once more
                        upon the world, she strove to find some means of earning her living in an
                        honest reputable way. Again she failed — wandering about, cold, hungry,
                        faint, helpless, comfortless;</p>
                     <p>"'So she turned again to sin, What had she to lose or win.' Step by step,
                        falling lower and lower, just five years after leaving the pleasant, happy
                        home of her childhood, she was picked up on the street, the very
                        off-scouring of one of our large cities, and conveyed to a hospital to die.
                        Some Christian ladies visited her there, in the love of Him who came 'to
                        seek and to save the lost.' Plucked as a brand from the burning, the poor
                        penitent was brought at last to the Saviour's feet.</p>
                     <p>"And where, during these five years of disappointed hopes, of blighted
                        affections, of weariness, of dreary loneliness, of deep contrition, of keen
                        remorse, of degradation and shame, where was the heartless seducer — the
                        deceiver? Rising high in his profession. In the houses of the wealthy and
                        influential, practising as a physician, received into the best families in
                        the land as medical adviser, and as an honoured guest; seated at their
                        tables, riding in their carriages, mingling freely with the chaste, the
                        pure, the high-minded. Two other victims attest his power to deceive, to
                        entice, to ruin — dying in agony, in ignominy — heart broken. Three homes
                        have been made desolate, from which he has enticed unsuspecting girls.
                        Visiting the hospital professionally, where Emily was dying, he drew near
                        the repulsive looking object, not imagining that his eyes looked upon the
                        once lovely, accomplished girl. As he bent over her, she recognised him.
                        Those dying eyes rested a moment upon his countenance, and the feeble voice
                        articulated, ' Harold, do you not know Emily?' Well might his cheek blanch
                        with horror. Well might his knees smite together as he looked upon the wreck
                        he had wrought. Christian women, this is no fancy sketch, but a true
                        unvarnished fact. Emily is gone to her last resting-place. Other Emilys
                        still live, still suffer. Will you not extend to them your sympathy, your
                        pity, your love? Reach out your hands to snatch them as a brand from the
                        burning. Harold still lives. There are many Harolds abroad in our land —
                        admired, honoured, entertained, trusted. Do you recognise one such in your
                        circle of acquaintance? Does he visit in your house, sit at your table, ride
                        in your carriage, converse with your daughters t contaminate your sons?
                        Beware.</p>
                     <p>After many wanderings, and visits to meetings and Friends, E. L. C. writes
                        on the 27th of 7th Mo., 68, "I have been at home about two weeks, and never
                        enjoyed my sweet, quiet, rural home more than I do now. The evergreens,
                        mountain ash, acacias, and sumachs have grown a great deal since dear L. and
                        L. A. have visited here. The house white-painted, with green Venetian blinds
                        outside each window, seems fairly embosomed in trees. The song of the birds
                        and the beautiful foliage are delightful to the eye and harmonious to the
                        ear. The graceful, feathery blossoms of the acacias, very fragrant, loading
                        the air with perfumes, and attracting the bees in large quantities. The blue
                        jay, a handsome bird, has built her nest and reared her yoang in the Norway
                        spruce, near our bedroom window. The Baltimore oriole refreshes us with her
                        melody. I have been sitting sewing, dear C. beside me, at our chamber
                        Avindow, and am thankful and happy. I often stayed my needle to look, to
                        drink in a draught of the beauty and luxuriance that God's bountiful hand
                        hath showered around us in rich profusion. The sumachs to the west of the
                        house, a horse chestnut, the tall poplars and some young weeping willows,
                        add to the varied beauty of the landscape, which is as pleasant a picture as
                        we can look upon in this level country. I am enjoying the rest and quiet of
                        home exceedingly. . . . Thank thee, dear C, for thy addition to dear L.'s
                        very interesting letter. We are rather amused at your account of that large

                     <p>The following is an extract from one of the papers referred to, and is
                        headed, "Go work in My vineyard." She writes, "For years I had heard the
                        language," and then describes her going to the Yearly Meeting, when eight
                        and a half years old, and listening to Elizabeth Fry, as narrated on page 2.
                        E.L.C. continues, "Year after year, when amid the vanities of youth, the
                        day- spring from on high visited my soul, the longing of my childhood was
                        renewed, and the prayer of my heart at times was, when I witnessed distress
                        and suffering, ' Here I am, send me.' .... When the duties and
                        responsibilities of a minister rested upon me, like most others in our
                        Society I devoted my attention to the meetings of Friends, chiefly. The
                        thought was often present of the poor, the outcast, the wanderers, the
                        prisoners, accompanied by a wish that Friends would labour with such. There
                        was a shrinking from walking in a new track, from entering upon a path that
                        I had not heard of any Friends engaging in, this side the Atlantic. It was
                        while attending the General Sabbath School Conference of Friends, in
                        Cincinnati, that the wide field of Mission labour was opened before me in an
                        unexpected way, accompanied by the commission, 'Go work in My vineyard.'</p>
                     <p>The last sitting of that Conference was a memorable season to me. Benjamin
                        Frankland, the able and successful Sabbath School Superintendent of the
                        Bethel mission, was called upon to speak. He made some admirable and very
                        practical remarks upon the subject, and wound up with language something
                        like this, as he turned to the seats where the ministers were sitting, '
                        Friends, when you go into your nice, com- fortable meeting houses, and
                        invite the people to come up there to you, to listen to the preaching of the
                        Gospel, and stop there, you are not following the example of your Saviour.
                        While he was found at times in the temple and the synagogue, he was found
                        far more frequently going from place to place, among, and surrounded by the
                        wandering, the suffering and the outcasts.'</p>
                     <p>"This earnest, impressive appeal from a young, devoted servant of the Lord,
                        met the witness for truth in my heart. That night sleep departed from my
                        eyes, and slumber from my eyelids. I could not rest. I was led into a close,
                        searching self-examination as to the reason why, after the early visitations
                        of my child- hood, I had not been labouring long ago among the poor and the
                        suffering, the outcasts and the wanderers. Serious reflection led me to the
                        conclusion that I had been too easily discouraged, and had, through this,
                        been negligent and unfaithful. I had let in the reasoner; the enemy had
                        suggested, 'Friends don't do this,' 'Friends don't do that.' 'Thy Monthly
                        Meeting will not give thee a minute for service so unusual,' &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>Excuses like this had withheld me. After spending some hours in the night
                        season thus reflecting, and in prayer before the Lord, I felt my peace
                        concerned in entering into solemn covenant with my Heavenly Father,
                        henceforth to dedicate myself to Him and to His service in this direction,
                        as he was pleased to open the way before me. Before the dawn of the morning,
                        not only was this resolution taken, but a letter written to the elders of my
                        Meeting and dear home friends, seeking their unity and sanction to my
                        prospect of labour in prisons, hospitals, asylums, in the streets and lanes
                        of some of our large cities, and in the highways and hedges of our rural
                        districts. My letter was cordially responded to by them, and my Monthly
                        Meeting, with full, cordial unity, granted me a minute. Never have they
                        hesitated from that day to this present time, but way has opened for every
                        service, and the words, ' I have set before thee an open door,' have been
                        sounded in my ear. No man can shut it. Peace has been the reward of
                        faithfulness. I have found more comfort, more substantial enjoyment in this
                        work, than in my whole life before. I have proved the truth of the
                        words.</p>

                     <p>In another contribution to the " Herald of Peace," she says, "I want to call
                        the attention of your readers to the difference between the labours of the
                        disciples in this day, and those of the primitive labourers in the church of
                        Christ. In those days three thousand were converted and added to the church
                        in one day. Now, we may look at some of our Friends' meetings, and see one
                        converted in three thousand days ! A wide difference, indeed I Christ
                        designed that His followers should be in the world, but not of tlie world.
                        The churches were planted in the cities; now we find in many places our
                        meeting houses are built in some quiet, retired, out of the way spot, as far
                        as may be from the wicked world, instead of standing as a light in the
                        world. ' The common people heard Him gladly,' 'the multitudes followed Him,'
                        and ' this man receiveth sinners,' was proverbial about Him. Now, we
                        sometimes hear it said, 'Quaker- ism is not adapted to the masses.' When the
                        poor outcasts, wanderers and sinners have their hearts touched, and are
                        awakened, and led to cry out ' What shall I do to be saved? ' where shall we
                        find a home for these in the church? They need its fostering care, its
                        tender sympathy. . . These matters claim the earnest, prayerful thought of
                        our members at this crisis, when so many are enquiring after the truth, as
                        we profess it, and many hearts are touched in our tract- reading, our
                        social, religious, and circulating meetings.</p>

                           A TRUE STORY.</head>
                     </div>
                     <div type="chapter">
                        <p>"HERE was a poor little ignorant, bare-footed slave-boy, living in South
                           Carolina ninety years ago, named Philip. He had never attended a meeting,
                           had never been to school — did not even know his letters, had never heard
                           of Jesus or of heaven, he had never heard the name of God but in profane
                           swearing, so that he did not know that God is good, and great, and kind,
                           and loving.</p>
                        <p>One day, a preacher passing along the road, saw the poor ragged boy, and
                           spoke kindly to him. He laid his hand upon his head and said, "Poor
                           little boy : w^hat is your name? " " Philip," was his reply. " Then,"
                           said the minister very solemnly, "little Philip must be a good boy, then
                           he will some day be an angel in heaven. Here little Philip goes about
                           bare-headed; there he will wear a golden crowai. Here he has only his one
                           coarse, ragged garment; there he will wear a beautiful white robe. Here
                           little Philip is bare-foot; there he may wear silver slip; ers and walk
                           on golden streets." The poor little boy looked and listened with
                           astonishment, and thought how wonderful a man that was that knew so -much
                           about God and heaven. Philip thought a great deal about what the minister
                           said to him. For many days he wandered about and looked up at the sky and
                           the clouds, and at the tree-tops, and longed to see God. He wanted to
                           know more about Him, and in his ignorant simplicity, thought he should
                           see Him. Day after day, he wandered and watched for Him. Night after
                           night he looked up at the tranquil moon and peaceful looking stars,
                           thinking perhaps God was there. When he heard the sweet song of the
                           birds, or listened to the wind swaying the tree-tops, he looked up with
                           awe, saying, " Is God there? " One day, as he thus looked and listened,
                           he thought he could hear a voice saying, " Child, pray ! Child, pray ! "
                           He Avent and told Aunt Rhoda, the old coloured woman, who said, " Philip,
                           that was God talking to you. You must mind what God says; you must pray
                           !" Poor little Philip did not know what this meant, but she explained to
                           him that he must kneel down and say, " 0 God, make Philip a good boy !'*
                           He went alone and prayed. In the woods, in the solitary places, by day
                           and by night, he called upon God, who heard his prayer; and "all at
                           once," he said, he felt as though God was with him, over him, all round
                           about him, he felt Him in his heart, and seemed as though he could see
                           Him in everything around him. Now he was happy. The next thing Philip did
                           was to talk to little July, one of his companions, and tell him how happy
                           he was. He led him to one of his places of prayer, and the two little
                           boys prayed together, and were very happy and rejoiced together. When
                           their master heard of their prayer, he scolded them, threatened to whip
                           them, and ordered them to leave off praying. Then they rose at three
                           o'clock in the morning that they might go out alone in the woods before
                           day and pray. Their cruel master, hearing of it, swore at them, and
                           threatened to " stop their praying or stop their breath." A few days
                           after, the slave-driver caught them praying, and their master had them
                           stripped, tied up, and severely whipped, twenty lashes with the bull-whip
                           and ten strokes with the paddle. Then with angry words he enquired, would
                           they leave off praying now. The helpless little sufferers meekly
                           answered, " 0 please, massa, do let us pray to God." " Give them another
                           round," was the harsh command. Twenty more lashes and ten more strokes
                           they received, and then they were asked if they would leave off praying.
                           " 0 please, massa, do let us pray to God," was all the answer of the poor
                           little boys, who were ordered to receive " another round." Then when cut
                           down, they were so weak they could not stand, but dropped down to the
                           ground that was crimsoned with their blood. Much kindness was shewn to
                           Philip and July by the negroes as soon as they had crawled away out of
                           sight of the "great house"; an old "aunty" washed and dressed their
                           wounds tenderly, while many tears were shed by those who could not, and
                           dared not, help them. The children did not give up praying, but cried all
                           the more earnestly to God for help. The master then turned his tactics,
                           and tried another plan to put an end to these prayer- meetings, in which
                           others were beginning to join. He tried the effect of ridicule, called
                           the child the "big preacher," "howling Philip," and other names in
                           derision. He told him he should build a high pulpit under a tree, and
                           send for all the negroes on the plantations near, and all the white
                           people round, and if he would preach and pray, he should do so before
                           them all the next Sabbath. The child was in an agony of terror, and
                           prayed to God more earnestly than ever, and asked Him to send some
                           minister to preach in his stead, as he did not know a single text of
                           Scripture, or a word to say. But when the time came, the two little boys,
                           hand in hand, mounted to the pulpit, all trembling with fear, as their
                           master stood near, deriding and mocking them. They did not know a letter
                           of the alphabet, and there stood their master, saying he would "hold the
                           Bible open for them to preach from, for of course they could not preach
                           without the Bible." The little boys as they stood trembling, lifted up
                           their hearts in prayer, and then broke forth into singing, and as their
                           little voices rose upon the air with the following lines, many hearts
                           were touched, and many tears were drawn from the eyes of the
                           by-standers:</p>

                        <p>By the time they had sung three verses of that sweet hymn, a great many
                           were bathed in tears, and on their knees crying for mercy. " Lord, have
                           mercy on me, a sinner ! " " Lord, help me ! " " Jesus, save me ! " and
                           other earnest prayers were heard. The children gained courage as they
                           sang, but their master was filled with fear, as he heard all the slaves
                           crying out for mercy, and closing the Bible in haste and throwing it
                           aside, he left them and went to his bedroom, and shut himself up there,
                           alone, for the rest of the day. He never opposed them afterwards, or
                           tried to hinder their prayers. The poor slaves held their prayer-meeting
                           regularly from that time, and many were converted unto God. "Little
                           Philip" is still living, an earnest servant of the Lord, nearly
                           ninety-nine years old. In speaking of these things he says, " God did
                           hear my prayers, and came and helped ' little Philip.' He thrashed a big
                           mountain with this poor little worm that day." He is now quietly waiting,
                           "Only waiting," he says, "till God calls him home." — E. L. 0.</p>

                        <p>Wouldst thou from sorrow find a sweet relief,</p>
                        <p>Or is thy heart oppressed with woes untold; Balm wouldst thou gather for
                           corroding grief,</p>

                        <p>Go to the cell of the convict. Listen with a sympathizing ear to the
                           story of sorrow, the tale of woe. Speak, in the name of Jesus, such
                           messages of love and mercy, or of earnest warning as He shall give thee
                           power to utter, asking for His blessing thereupon. Often have I seen the
                           head of the strong man bowed, and the tears trickling down the bronzed
                           cheek, at the sound of a woman's voice. ' Oh! how you remind me of my
                           mother," said one. "I had a good mother; if I had taken her advice, I
                           should never have been here." "I have never heard a kind sympathizing
                           word since my mother died," said another, " and you speak just as she
                           did."</p>
                        <p>Do you say that you have not the power to go and speak to the prisoners ?
                           Remember Who it is that hath said that He would account a deed of
                           kindness or of self-renouncing love to any of His suffering children as
                           done unto Himself. He was once a prisoner, and enjoins visiting the
                           prisoners, as a mark of love for, and allegiance to Himself. Art thou
                           lacking in power and wisdom, and skill for the work? Go, ask Him for
                           power. Ask Him for wisdom, "who giveth to all men liberally, and
                           upbraideth not." Ask Him what He would have thee to do. Perhaps He may
                           give thee skill to reach the heart by speaking to them collectively, or
                           He may be pleased to commission thee to go from cell to cell, with words
                           of loving sympathy, with a few tracts or a few flowers, and He will bless
                           the seed thus sown.</p>
                        <p>Two dear young ladies of my acquaintance, after our meeting with 1,350
                           prisoners at Sing Sing, spent a little time in going to visit the women
                           in their cells, and gave them each a little bouquet of flowers, and a
                           sweet hymn or tract.</p>

                        <p>These little presents gave great pleasure to those poor convicts, who
                           have so few comforts, and so few friends to care for them. The prison
                           hospital is often good ground, well prepared for the seed to fall upon.
                           When the prisoners are ill, their hearts are often tender, and peculiarly
                           susceptible of good impressions. Among all the interesting cases that
                           have come under my notice, w^as one that I shall never forget w^hile
                           memory remains.</p>
                        <p>In the hospital in Sing Sing prison,! found an intelligent,
                           youthful-looking convict, far gone in pulmonary ■consumption. Beside his
                           bed was a stand, and on the stand a Bible. " Would you like to see my
                           mother's Bible? " he enquired, after I had conversed with him a few
                           minutes. As I took it from his feeble, trembling hand. I observed that it
                           bore the marks of being well used, I noticed pencillings in the margin,
                           and twenty* little slips of paper scattered through the book, between the
                           leaves, each one containing a text from the Bible, and numbered one, two,
                           three, to twenty. It was a sad story that I heard, partly from himself,
                           and partly from the chaplain at his bedside. When brought to the prison,
                           six months previously, " he was the only son of his mother, and she was a
                           widow," a pious w^oman, but too indulgent to her fatherless boy. She
                           loved him •dearly, but could not bear to thwart him. The result was that
                           he grew up headstrong and self-willed, resisting all restraint, choosing
                           evil associates, he w^as led into mischief and sin, and finally, when
                           only ■eighteen or nineteen years of age, the mother's heart ^'as almost
                           broken by the heavy tidings that her boy had been arrested, tried, and
                           sent to the State prison for three years, in company with some others,
                           old offenders, who had led him into sin.</p>
                        <p>This painful intelligence seemed to be the one drop too much for his
                           mother's cup of bitterness. Always delicate, her strength seemed to give
                           way, and she felt that she was not long for this world. Her heart's
                           desire was to see her boy once more before her death. Sum- moning all her
                           energy, gathering her little remaining strength, she undertook the
                           journey by easy stages, and, within the precincts of the prison, her only
                           child was brought before her in his convict's suit. What tongue can
                           portray the feelings of that stricken mother, in that last sad interview
                           with her wandering boy ? Who shall describe that loving mother's last
                           counsels, her tender embrace, her parting words, her looks of love, her
                           earnest, prayerful benediction ? Her Bible, his father's wedding present
                           upon the bridal morn, that she had read daily for twenty-one years, she
                           placed in the hand of her boy, with the few words, " Read it every day,
                           my child, for my sake. May it be your consolation in sorrow and
                           loneliness, as it has been mine. May God have mercy upon you, and grant
                           that we may meet in heaven, for Christ's sake, for we shall never, never
                           meet again on earth."</p>
                        <p>The fainting mother was borne back to the carriage which was to convey
                           her to her desolate home, there to pine, to droop, to die. Her son was
                           remanded to his cell, to ponder upon the desolation that his sin had
                           wrought, with his mother's Bible for his only com- panion. Never very
                           strong, inheriting his mother's constitutional weakness, the prison
                           discipline, hard work, hard fare, reduced his physical strength, and
                           when, three Aveeks after this trying scene, the announcement was suddenly
                           made to him, " Your mother is dead," he could bear no more. He was taken
                           to the hospital, in which I found him, and where he had been six w^eeks.
                           Opening his Bible, I found on the slip of paper No. 1 the w^ords, " Oh,
                           wretched man that I am : who shall deliver me from the body of this
                           death? " Upon these w^ords he had pondered for many days, in an agony of
                           distress, exclaiming at intervals, " Oh, my mother, my dear mother ! I
                           have killed the best of mothers." His remorse was fearful as he upbraided
                           himself w'ith being his mother's murderer. His anguish of mind produced
                           fever, and, at times, mental aberration. When reason had deserted her
                           throne, he w^ould cry out for his mother to come and smooth his pillowy
                           to lave his burning brow, to moisten his parched lips, and alleviate his
                           sufferings, and minister to him as she used to do in former times, when
                           he was a little boy, sick and suffering. Then, as the fever subsided, a
                           terrible season of exhaustion and helplessness would ensue, accompanied
                           by a sense of utter desolation, and his now thoroughly awakened
                           conscience would upbraid him with destroying his mother. " Now I shall
                           never, never hear her sweet voice again," he said, " her arms will never
                           be lovingly thrown around me. She will never more watch over me in
                           sickness, or soothe me in sorrow^, or shield me from shame. Oh, my
                           mother, my dear, dear mother ! "</p>
                        <p>While thus mourning in unavailing anguish, his attention was attracted by
                           some of his mother's marginal pencillings, by the text No. 2, upon a slip
                           of paper, " God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son,
                           that whosoever believeth on Him should not perish but have everlasting
                           life." The mother's feeble hand had traced the words, "God loves you, my
                           child." Here was comfort for the comfortless boy.</p>
                        <p>No. 3 contained the words This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all
                           acceptation, that Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners, of
                           whom I am chief." Here were words of consolation, long pondered upon.</p>
                        <p>No. 4, "Verily I say unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot
                           enter into the kingdom of God."</p>
                        <p>No. 5, "Now the fruits of the flesh are . . ."</p>
                        <p>No. 6, "Now the fruits of the spirit are love and peace."</p>
                        <p>Thus, step by step, it seemed, the poor penitent, alone and desolate, had
                           the way of life and salvation unfolded before him. The Spirit of the
                           Lord, as a convictor of sin, a comforter, a counsellor, an instructor,
                           was with him, teaching him, leading him along. As so many
                           stepping-stones, these beautiful passages followed each other, depicting
                           the Christian's course upward and onward, until on reaching Nos. 18, 19
                           and 20, I found the joys of the redeemed portrayed, as in the seventh,
                           fourteenth and twenty-first chapters of Revelations.</p>
                        <p>No. 18 told of the "great multitude which no man could number, of all
                           nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongaes, clothed with white robes
                           and with palms in their hands."</p>
                        <p>No. 19, " These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have
                           washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb,"
                           etc.</p>
                        <p>No. 20, "And they sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the
                           song of the Lamb, saying, ' Great and marvellous are thy works. Lord God
                           Almighty, just and true are thy ways, thou King of Saints.' "</p>
                        <p>These striking passages had been arranged as a string of precious pearls
                           by the prisoner, who was now feeling the sweet peace resulting from the
                           language "Thy sins be forgiven thee," and trusting in his Saviour, he was
                           patiently waiting until he should receive the summons to stand before his
                           God. After a sweet season of prayer and thanksgiving, we parted. A few
                           months later, upon visiting Sing Sing, I went into the hospital. I found
                           the bed; it was empty. The stand was there — the Bible gone. Inquiring
                           for the young prisoner, I was prepared to hear the news, " He is dead." "
                           He died happily," said one of the attendants. My spirit rejoiced with,
                           and for, the ransomed prisoner. I gave thanks that another redeemed one
                           was added to the countless multitude above — another gem in the Saviour's
                           crown — another blood-bought soul to celebrate the wonders of creative
                           power, the riches of redeeming love.</p>

                        <p>"Thy very welcome letter of the 21th ult. reached me last week in
                           Chicago. I commenced a reply, and have left it there, so begin another
                           here. ... I feel that we do not keep up so brisk a correspondence as
                           would be pleasant. My own very pressing engagements in a ministerial and
                           missionary line, almost absorb my thoughts and feelings, and I do not get
                           much time for writing social or family correspondence. Thou and I are
                           well assured of each other's tender and sisterly love, and this will be a
                           comfort to us both oft-times when it is not expressed. For two years, I
                           had looked forward toward spending a winter in the South. The prisons in
                           the Southern States, I had heard, were in a sad condition, quite as bad
                           as Newgate, when Elizabeth Fry visited it in 1816, and as the prisons on
                           the European Continent when John Howard visited them. Two years ago it
                           was on my mind to go there, when dear Sybil Jones went, and she and I had
                           some correspondence about it. I named it to my dear husband, and he said,
                           ' Wait until next winter, and I will let out my farm and go with thee.' I
                           waited. The next winter came — he could not go, but earnestly pleaded
                           'wait another year, and then I think I can go.' Again I delayed, and the
                           prospect weakened with each delay, and other servants of the Lord were
                           sent to work in that vineyard, and have- accomplished a great deal there.
                           There is no longer the urgent call for me to go, and as that prospect
                           closed, another opened in Chicago, and J.'s mind has been gradually
                           preparing for it. He is now arranging to let his farm in the. fall, and
                           he and I expect to spend next winter- in Chicago. We are not likely to
                           move our household furniture away from Rollin, but simply to board there
                           for a few months. It is a great comfort to me to have my dear husband
                           with me in my work. TTe have been so much separated during our short
                           married life, and now that we have the last three years been more
                           together, we feel more closely united, less willing to be separated, more
                           absolutely necessary to each other; and if we can work together in the
                           vineyard of the Lord, we rejoice. Dear C. is now in the Rowland
                           Institute; we expect her home next month. She will spend the winter with
                           us in Chicago. It will be very delightful to me to have her again with
                           me, and to her also. She and her father keep up a regular correspondence,
                           and seem to appreciate each other.</p>
                        <p>"I was very much interested in thy graphic description of the pleasant
                           home and surroundings of our uncle and aunt at Maidenhead, and at
                           Maidstone likewise. No wonder Aunt A. begins to look like an aged woman.
                           She is sixteen years older than I am. My hair is getting grey, and my
                           memory is failing, except upon a few points that it has been much
                           exercised upon, as Scripture passages, beautiful poetry that I learned
                           when a child, and scenes of suffering that I have witnessed in prisons,
                           hospitals, and lunatic asylums. People will sometimes accost me with *
                           Mrs. Comstock. what a wouderful memory you have,' ' I wish I had your
                           memory,' &amp;c. It is ti sreat mistake, my memory runs in ruts and
                           grooves^ and does not run at all out of these. I am now in the house of
                           friends likely to revive past associations, to call before memory's page
                           the scenes of my childhood and youth. H.H. and wife, very pleasant
                           Friends in a very comfortable home. He and his sister, M.A.H., were
                           Croydon scholars. They, with their parents, live here in a beautiful
                           village near the lake. A Friend from Chicago, R.P., is my companion.
                           There are seven or eight families of Friends scattered over a space of
                           sixteen or eighteen miles, west of Lake Michigan. They have no meeting.
                           We are encouraging them to start one. I expect to hold a public meeting
                           each evening for a week, and visit the Friends and families and the
                           schools during the day, in two or three villages or towns. . . . Thy
                           sketch of the Yearly Meeting interested me. There is one thing in your
                           Y.M. I do not like. Why should you call the Men's Meeting ' l^he Yearly
                           Meetmg? ' For our Society, of all others, to allow the self-styled '
                           Lords of the Creation ' to arrogate so much to themselves, is outrageous.
                           We profess to be the only pure democracy in the world — men and women
                           being one — on an absolute equality in the Lord Jesus, is one of our
                           fundamental doctrines. Such a thing as calling themselves the Yearly
                           Meeting, would not be suffered in our men. We have one Y.M. in New York,
                           with two branches, equal in every respect. The same in Ohio, Indiana,
                           &amp;c. We expect another General Meeting in Indiana, to be held in or
                           near Wabash, next Eighth month, that will be very interesting probably.
                           It will partake of the nature of a Y.M. minus the tedious, uninteresting
                           queries. When we were girls we disliked the queries. Then it was a sort
                           of instinct; now mature reason comes in with a powerful force, confirming
                           the childish judgment.</p>

                        <p>I do not think the queries do any good. They do not at all represent the
                           state of the Society. I hope to live to see the day when they will be
                           materially altered or abolished.</p>

                        <p>I cannot go forth and preach the gospel as John H. Douglas does. I have
                           neither eloquence of tongue nor fluency of speech. I cannot go, like
                           those faithful missionaries, Louis and Sarah Street, to Madagascar, to
                           instruct the heathen. I cannot go, like Elizabeth Fry, to the prisons,
                           and speak comforting words to the convicts, or to the houses of ill-fame,
                           to snatch the poor wanderers as brands from the burning." I cannot visit
                           the drinking saloons to persuade the victims of intemperance to turn away
                           from the intoxicating cup; neither can I allure the young sons of our
                           land to leave the gaming table and the insinuating enticements of the
                           billiard room. I am poor and cannot even go round to minister to the
                           wants of the destitute and suffering, by giving them food and clothing.
                           Yet I love my Saviour, and desire to work for Jesus. What can I do? Such
                           language is sometimes spoken to me, and in reply I say: —</p>

                        <p>Ever ready to command; If you cannot towards the needy</p>
                        <p>Reach an ever open hand; You can visit the afflicted,</p>
                        <p>O'er the erring you can weep; You can be a true disciple,</p>
                        <p>Sitting at the Saviour's feet.</p>
                        <p>Do not then stand idly waiting</p>
                        <p>For some greater work to do; Fortune is a lazy goddess,</p>
                        <p>She will never come to you : Go and toil in any vineyard.</p>
                        <p>Do not fear to do or dare, If you want a field of labour,</p>
                        <p>You can find it anywhere ! "</p>
                        <p>"Go out into the streets and lanes of the city." Turn into the narrow
                           alley — descend into the damp cellar, or climb the rickety stairs into
                           the sultry attic — sit beside the bed of the sufferer — tell the lonely,
                           tried spirit of an ever present friend and comforter. Read a psalm,
                           repeat a hymn, or kneel in prayer, as your best feelings may dictate, or
                           circumstances prompt. Visit the wife of the drunkard, soothe and cheer
                           her, aid her by your sympathy and counsels. Her heart is oppressed, her
                           spirit crushed by a weary weight of woe, she receives but little human
                           sympathy. To the voice of kindness she is almost a stranger. Harsh words,
                           unkind reproaches, and oft-times heavy blows, poverty, and severe
                           privations are her lot. Comfort her in her tribu- lation, soothe her in
                           her sorrow. Do not forget to take tracts, leaflets for the children, and
                           distribute as you go. Visit the county poor-house and the city
                           infirmary.</p>

                        <p>Such a company as the compassionate Saviour beheld at Bethesda's pool we
                           find in the poor-houses and alms- houses — " a multitude of impotent
                           folk, blind, halt, withered, &amp;c." Tell these of his tender care for
                           such. Read the first few verses of the fifth chapter of John^ and point
                           out to them the similarity, and at the same time the diversity, between
                           the account here narrated and their own case — that whereas</p>
                        <p>"At times and at seasons the angel had power,</p>
                        <p>At the pool of Bethesda to heal, Whenever his people are willing, that
                           hour Christ heareth the sinner's appeal. Tho' their sins be as scarlet,
                           or crimson their dye. He will make them as snow, unto mercy's meek
                           eye."</p>
                        <p>In one of my visits to a city almshouse my attention was arrested by a
                           countenance of uncommon intelligence. A meek, patient sufferer, in
                           lingering consumption, was quietly awaiting the summons to quit the clay
                           tenement and enter into the joy of her Lord. She was in her thirty-fifth
                           year, " had known better days," having been in early life the beloved and
                           only child of a minister of the Gospel. Her mother was removed by death
                           when she was a child, and her tender and beloved father when she was
                           twenty-five years of age, leaving her a comfortable cottage home and a
                           property of about ten thousand dollars. The failure of a bank deprived
                           her of the greater part of her little patrimony — ill-health and other
                           adverse and unlooked for circumstances swept away the rest, so that in
                           three or four years after her father's death she found herself without a
                           home and without funds, no near relatives, and in poor health. In
                           speaking of her past trials and losses, and her present privations, she
                           said, " And yet I have enjoyed more real peace of mind during the six or
                           seven years I have been in this house than in my whole life before. When
                           I found myself homeless, ill, and friendless, I looked to my Saviour as I
                           had never looked before. I clung to Him as my only friend ! " She spoke
                           of her joy and peace in believing in Him, of her entire trust in Him, of
                           the happiness awaiting her in the unseen eternal world. During three or
                           four successive visits that I paid her she seemed to have no cloud to mar
                           the bright future, no doubt, no fear. Her trust was confiding and simple
                           as that of a little child, and almost the last words I heard from her
                           feeble, faltering voice were snatches from that sweet hymn of Alexander
                           Pope's:</p>

                              dying; Cease, fond nature ! cease thy strife, And let me languish into
                              life !</p>

                        <p>I.— The Bible Lesson: or What Aunt Elizabeth Saw</p>

                        <p>"Auntie, do tell us about the State prison near Chicago," said my niece
                           M.</p>
                        <p>"Oh, yes, auntie, do please tell us all about the prisoners, and how they
                           acted, and what they said," responded L.</p>
                        <p>"Auntie, did they have chains on, and were all the doors locked and
                           bolted ? " inquired W.</p>
                        <p>"Some of them w^ere chained, and most of them were shut up in small
                           cells, and there were chains, and bars, and bolts, but I will tell you
                           about another prison now, and let you know about Joliet State prison
                           another time."</p>
                        <p>"Oh yes, auntie, shut your eyes, and look with your mind, and tell us
                           what you see."</p>
                        <p>"I see a prison, and a prisoner sitting in it. He is a very good man. A
                           wicked king shut him up there because he loved Jesus, and used to preach
                           to the people about Him. The prisoner has a chain fastened by an iron
                           ring round each wrist, and a soldier is chained to each of his hands, for
                           fear he should try to get away. He has been tried, and sentence has been
                           passed upon him, and he is to be executed on the morrows His friends had
                           a prayer meeting, and prayed all night to God to save him. God heard
                           their prayer, and sent an angel down from heaven to the prison, in the
                           middle of the night. The angel found the prisoner fast asleep, he awoke
                           him, told him to get up quickly? and follow^ him. The chains fell off the
                           prisoner's wrists when the angel touched him, but did not wake the
                           guards, who were chained to him. The prisoner rose up, put on his girdle,
                           his sandals and cloak, at the command of the angel, and followed him.
                           There was a bright light shining in the dark and gloomy prison while the
                           angel was there, but when he had gone away, it was dark as before. The
                           prisoner was so much astonished that he thought he must be dreaming, as
                           he followed his guide out of the prison, and right to the iron gate of
                           the city. Fortified cities, in those days, had large, strong, heavy gates
                           at every en- trance. When they reached the gate, it opened to them of its
                           own accord, and they went safely through, and down one street. Then the
                           angel left him, and the prisoner was free. The first thing he did was to
                           go to the house where his friends were praying for him. When he knocked
                           at the gate, a girl went to open it, and when she heard his voice she was
                           so glad that she ran into the house to tell them. They were so aston-
                           ished that they could not believe her, but thought she was mad. Some
                           said, ' It is his angel,' but when they had opened the door, and found
                           that it was really he^ they were astonished. Then he told them how the
                           Lord had sent His angel to deliver him from the prison and from death;
                           and they rejoiced together. In the morning there was a great stir in the
                           prison when the guards awoke, and found that their prisoner had escaped.
                           They made a great search for him, but could not find him. He lived for
                           many years, and was an able minister of the Lord Jesus Christ. "Who was
                           the prisoner? What wicked king imprisoned him? Where was the prison?</p>

                        <p>"I see a beautiful country, diversified with moun- tain and valley, hill
                           and dale, wood and water. I see a beautiful city also, one of the oldest
                           cities on the face of the earth. It was a flourishing city 4,000 years
                           ago, and it is so still. It is situated at the confluence of two
                           beautiful rivers, and a range of lofty mountains near at hand, from the
                           summit of which there is a fine sea view. I see a king, a powerful
                           monarch. He is not a good one. He was a proud, wicked man.</p>
                        <p>"I see a great, victorious general, who has been in many battles, and
                           gained great renown. He has a splendid palace home, and plenty of horses
                           and chariots. He has a beautiful garden with flowers and fruits.</p>
                        <p>"' There the feathery palm trees rise, And the date grows ripe under
                           sunny skies.'</p>
                        <p>There are orange groves and vineyards, abundance of apricots, chestnuts,
                           olives and pomegranates. He has a great many servants to wait upon him,
                           and friends to flatter him, and a purse full of money. Yet he is not
                           happy. What ails him? He looks very ill. His skin is very white, covered
                           with purple spots.</p>

                        <p>He has a terrible disease, which no doctor in the whole land can
                           cure.</p>
                        <p>"I see a young girl. She is in trouble also. She looks lonely and sad,
                           and she has been weeping. Poor child, she has been stolen away from her
                           parents, and taken to a foreign land, and she thinks she will never see
                           her father and mother again . Th e rich man brought her home a captive
                           when he returned from battle, and now she is a slave in his house and
                           waits upon his wife. She sees her master suffering, and (returning good
                           for evil) she tells her mistress that in her native land there is a holy
                           man, a prophet of the Lord, who can cure him.</p>
                        <p>"The sick man, with much pomp and many servants, went to the land the
                           girl had spoken of, and presenting himself at the house of the prophet,
                           expected that he would be handsomely received, and great respect shown to
                           him. But when the holy man of God sent him a message to ' Go, and wash
                           seven times,' in a small river, he was offended, and went away in a rage,
                           and would have gone home again as ill as he came. It was well for the
                           proud man that he had good servants.</p>
                        <p>*' One of his retinue expostulated with him, saying, * If the prophet had
                           bid thee do some great thing, wouldst thou not have done it? ' and
                           represented to him how much easier it was to do this simple thing, to
                           'wash and be clean.' The general listened to the advice of his faithful
                           servant, and went and dipped himself seven times in the river, though it
                           was not so beautiful as those of his native city. He was immedi- ately
                           healed, and felt himself quite strong and well.</p>

                        <p>"With a heart filled with gratitude, he returned to the prophet, and
                           confessed that he now felt that there was only one true God ruling the
                           earth, and that henceforth he should worship Him alone. In the gratitude
                           of his heart, he presented the prophet with some handsome and valuable
                           presents, which he refused to take; but his servant coveting the good
                           things, followed after the rich man when he was on his way home, and by
                           inventing a tissue of falsehood, procured from him two talents of silver
                           and two changes of raiment, and hid them away, supposing the prophet
                           would not know anything about them. But he was mistaken, for the next
                           time he entered his presence, he accosted him with the words 'Whence
                           comest thou The lying lips made answer, 'Thy servant went no whither. He
                           could not deceive the prophet, who replied, 'Went not my heart with thee,
                           when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee?' Then he
                           pronounced sentence upon him, that for his deception and fraud, the very
                           disease of which the general had been cured, should cleave unto him as
                           long as he lived.</p>

                        <p>L. — "Now Auntie, do please come and sit here with us, and tell us a good
                           Bible story."</p>
                        <p>W. — "Auntie, I never knew before that there were such beautiful stories
                           in the Bible."</p>
                        <p>L. — "Are there a great many more, or have you told us nearly all of
                           them?"</p>
                        <p>Auntie. — "There are a great many more; I might tell you one every
                           evening for a year, and not get to the end of them."</p>
                        <p>A. — "0! I am so glad! one every evening for a year! — that will be more
                           than 300. Now, we are all ready, listening."</p>
                        <p>Auntie. — "I see a lady sitting under a palm tree."</p>
                        <p>L. — "Was she a beautiful lady, auntie?"</p>
                        <p>Auntie, — "The Bible does not speak of her beauty, but she was a good
                           lady. Her name begins with D., the wife of L. Her people had been
                           suffering cruel oppression for twenty years, from a cruel king, J., of C.
                           One day, seated beneath the shade of her palm tree on the side of Mount
                           T., beautiful valleys, and pleasant, fertile gardens and vineyards before
                           her, a little rippling stream gushing from the hillside, splashing down
                           and widening as it wound along the distant valley, until it was wide and
                           deep enough to deserve the name of the river K. As she sat she pondered
                           upon the wrongs of her oppressed people. Those fields of waving grain
                           ripening for the sickle, would soon be reaped by the oppressor. The fruit
                           of those olive-yards and vineyards, her people could not enjoy. The wheat
                           must be threshed in some secret spot, behind the winepress, that their
                           rulers might not see it, and rob them of the fruit of their toil. The
                           highways looked desolate and unoccupied, and the people passed in secret
                           through the bye-w^ays ; the inhabitants of the villages dwindled down,
                           trade was impeded, commerce stopped, and the people were greatly cast
                           down. As the lady thought of all these wrongs, she sent for the General
                           of the army, B., the son of A. to come to her. He came, she consulted
                           with him, and requested him to resist the enemy and the oppressor, and to
                           drive them back to their own land, H. of the G. The general listened to
                           her plans, and promised to go if she would accompany the army. She
                           consented, and the next day they were ready with 10,000 soldiers to
                           withstand their tyrannical oppressor. Then was the strange sight seen of
                           a lady riding with an army of soldiers, leading them on to battle."</p>
                        <p>"Oh,now I know all about it, "said Fred," it was Joan of Arc. I read
                           about her in my history the other day."</p>
                        <p>Auntie — "Wait, my boy, until I have finished my story, and then guess.
                           Now we turn to another scene. There are some ladies sitting at a window.
                           One of them is the mother of S., the General of the invading army. He had
                           gained so many victories and brought home so much spoil every time he had
                           been out, that they quite expected he would be successful again. As they
                           watched and waited they said, 'Why is his chariot so long in coming? Why
                           tarry the wheels of his chariot?' They wondered what detained him, and
                           hoped he was gaining victories, and going to bring home some beautiful
                           captives, and some costly dresses and jewellery.</p>
                        <p>"And now another sight I see. Soldiers fleeing away in haste — the
                           invading army is completely routed — the proud General is running fast
                           and alone in the heat of the day. He is weary, hot, and hungry, sees a
                           tent by the way-side, enters it, and asks for water to drink of a woman
                           named J., the wife of H. the K. He asked for water and she gave him milk.
                           She brought forth butter in a lordly dish. After taking a meal he lay
                           down to rest, and when asleep the woman sees the enemy of her people, the
                           oppressor, the tyrant, in her power. She resolves to destroy him, and to
                           deliver her oppressed people. With a long nail in one hand and a hammer
                           in the other she approaches him and drives the nail through his temples,
                           rejoicing that her nation is avenged, that her people are free.</p>
                        <p>"This happened thousands of years ago. What reason we have to be thankful
                           that since that day the Prince of Peace has come into the world, and now
                           we may love our enemies and 'overcome evil with good.' "Down the dark
                           future, thro' long generations. The echoing sounds grow fainter, and then
                           cease; And, like a bell, with solemn, sweet vibrations, I hear once more
                           the voice of Christ say ' Peace,' Peace! and no longer from its brazen
                           portals The blast of War's great organ shakes the skies ! But beautiful
                           as songs of the immortals. The holy melodies of love arise."</p>

                        <p>"Now can you tell me the names of all the persons whose initials I have
                           given?"</p>
                        <p>Addressing some children in a Sabbath school, E.L.C. endeavoured to
                           impress upon them the need for their own sakes of parental care and
                           restriction, and the desirableness of strict submission to the
                           requirements of those set over them. She related the case of a boy in
                           America, whose parents did not succeed in controlling his will, and who
                           so completely got the law into his own hands that all attempts to govern
                           him were given up. This had not gone on long before the boy was taken up
                           for some misdemeanour, and placed in the State penitentiary. Here he
                           attempted to con- tinue his determination not to be over-ruled, and
                           underw^ent one punishment after another, without result, when he was
                           condemned to be placed in the pump-room. This was a room built of stone
                           in a bason- like shape, perfectly water-tight, and lighted from the roof.
                           The prisoner was placed alone in the apartment, and locked in, when water
                           was allowed gradually to enter, and soon covered the floor. In the centre
                           was placed a pump, by working which the inmate could get rid of the
                           water, but in no other way. The youth declared he would never work that
                           pump, he was not going to do what they told him. The water rose to his
                           knees, then to his waist, but he was still resolute and defiant. The
                           process gradually went on, and at last the poor fellow, now completely
                           broken down, seeing that his life was in danger, commenced pumping in
                           real earnest. From that time he became amenable to the rules of the
                           penitentiary, and under kind but firm discipline, during the remainder of
                           his term of imprisonment he improved so much that, on his release, he
                           entered on a course of patient industry, which in time resulted in his
                           establishment in business, and his eventually occupying a very
                           respectable social position.</p>
                        <p>On tract distribution, E. L. C. writes : — " Wisely and carefully
                           selected tracts may be a great element of good; but carelessly and
                           indiscriminately scattered, they may not only be useless, but absolutely
                           pernicious reading. On one occasion, while passing through the military
                           hospitals in Washington, I was accosted by a plainly dressed Friend, who
                           kindly offered to supply me with all the tracts I wanted, if I would
                           confine myself to those which were issued by the Tract Association of
                           Friends in Philadelphia. I could not accede to his request, as those
                           tracts, though very excellent, were not adapted to the class of people I
                           was visiting. Leaving him, I entered the hospital ward he had just passed
                           through. A young soldier was sitting up in bed, reading a tract against
                           dancing. At the end of the first paragraph he exclaimed, ' Comrades, I
                           have taken my last step in the giddy dance.' This was followed by a merry
                           peal of laughter through the ward. Another sentence he read, and made
                           merry over with his companions, advising them not to be so wicked as to
                           dance again, but to follow his example ! When the laughter subsided, I
                           enquired of the nurse what was amusing them so much, as I could see
                           nothing in what he had read to call forth such merriment. She replied, *A
                           Quaker gentleman has just been here distributing tracts, and he has given
                           that poor fellow, who has lost both his feet, one against dancing.'</p>
                        <p>"In the Eastern Penitentiary in Philadelphia, where were many hundred
                           prisoners, I found one with a tract on ' Plainness of Dress,' and the
                           owner of it handed it to me saying, ' I like what that gentleman says
                           first-rate, and I wish the authorities here were all Quakers. I should
                           like a broad-cloth suit a great deal better than these stripes,'
                           referring to his convict's costume.* In another cell, a prisoner was
                           poring over a tract, ' On the Superstitious Observance of the First Day
                           of the Week.' He had been arrested for an offence committed w^hile drunk
                           on the Sabbath, and I could not but think how much better it would have
                           been for him if he had observed the day, however superstitiously. In a
                           third cell was a convict with a soiled and well-thumbed tract in his
                           hand. I enquired * Hast thou an interesting tract there ?' to which he
                           replied by reading the title, 'A Warning against Seducing Spirits,'
                           adding, ' I can't make head nor tail of it — I don't know what kind of
                           spirit them ere war, but I reckon they warn't gin, nor rum, nor whiskey.'
                           . . . I exchanged his tract for ' The Fool's Pence,' an excellent
                           temperance story."</p>
                        <p>"In many of the American prisons the convicts wear a striped costume, and
                           E, L. C. who had visited several of them, once stopped her sister on one
                           of her visits to England, as they were out walking, and came in sight of
                           a lively game at football, with the question, " What are all those
                           convicts doing in that field?"</p>

                        <p>Bloomington, Illinois, 30-10-68. "I WAS awoke this morning by L.A.
                           kissing me, N and wishing me ' many happy returns of my birthday.' Very
                           varied have been the scenes amid which these anniversaries have come
                           round to me during the past twelve or fourteen years. One as a stranger
                           in a strange land, L.A. and C. with me to give their loving greetings,
                           and a letter from thee, hailing me lovingly across the Atlantic. One amid
                           prosperity and joy in Canada, when I felt that I could erect an altar,
                           and inscribe thereon, ' Ebenezer, hitherto hath the Lord helped me ! '
                           Again in Canada, dear L. with me, with loving greetings, and dear F. and
                           R. and the little ones, so that I could almost adopt the language again,
                           ' I dwell among mine own people,' though still remembering some loved
                           relatives in a distant land.</p>
                        <p>"Another anniversary found me a wanderer, travelling among strangers, but
                           rejoicing in this benediction, ' Blessed is the man that hath found his
                           work, he need desire no greater blessedness.' In comforting the afflicted
                           and soothing the sorrowing I found a joy I had never known before.</p>

                        <p>"Another anniversary came round and found me in a humble home of my own,
                           yet one of His providing. I felt a peaceful contentment with such things
                           as I had. After awhile, other scenes than my quiet rural home marked my
                           anniversaries. One was passed in a State Prison, comforting, soothing,
                           and counselling the poor convicts, another was characterized by a visit
                           to the President, in the Executive Mansion at Washington, and, while the
                           Union flag of our country floated aloft, I felt the language of my
                           grateful heart to be the inscription of Moses upon his altar, ' Jehovah
                           Nissi, the Lord my banner.'</p>
                        <p>"Another anniversary found me in the hospitals, surrounded by sick and
                           wounded and suffering soldiers. Amid the shrieks of the suff'ering and
                           the groans of the dying my altar was erected — my inscription and prayer
                           alike that of Gideon formerly, ' Jehovah Shalom, the Lord send peace ! '
                           Now, the fifty-third anniversary finds me here. I was at Adrian,
                           attending our Quarterly Meeting, when a despatch reached me, summoning me
                           here ; a dear friend was dying, and very much desired my presence, and
                           that I should attend her funeral. The telegram invited me to hasten
                           immediately to Bloomington, 340 miles. I obeyed the summons, and brought
                           L. A. with me. Our friends received us lovingly, and are entertaining us
                           most kindly. The dear sufferer breathed her last, and the redeemed spirit
                           took its flight just as our train steamed into the town, so that I did
                           not have the satisfaction of seeing and conversing with her, but her
                           death-bed has been so peaceful and happy that we have the assurance that
                           all was well. Her dear Saviour was with her, ' the lamp of His love was
                           her guide through the gloom ' of the otherwise dark valley, His love and
                           His mercy were her constant themes during the three weeks she was ill,
                           and now her themes for ever and for evermore will be the wonders of
                           creative power, the riches of redeeming love. . . In a few days, we go to
                           Chicago. Dear love to all your circle."</p>

                           since thy departure from our shores. Feeling little of consequence at the

                           that life with thy dear self, as with many others is full of cares, and
                           imposes much every way, the idea, like a flickering rushlight, passes
                           away.</p>
                        <p>"We are all quite well. Elizabeth is at Chicago, where she has been
                           three-fourths of her time, perhaps, for the past five months. Sister L.A.
                           is here taking a short rest ; soon returns to that city again. Chicago is
                           growing. Thirty thousand inhabitants are said to be added to its
                           population annually, with some eight thousand buildings</p>
                        <p>"Friends are doing something in this country. They have now some eighteen
                           Schools in Virginia, among the people of colour. Our new President has
                           the confidence and sympathies of the people generally, here. His home is
                           at Galona, Illinois, on the Mississippi. On the night following the
                           election he sat up until two o'clock, when it was fully ascertained at
                           the Telegraph Office of that place that Grant had received that day, in
                           the different States, more than two-thirds the votes cast for elections.
                           He then retired for the night and slept well; though every- one around
                           him seemed much excited, yet he was perfectly cool and calm.</p>
                        <p>"We understand he has recently appointed a Friend in Philadelphia as
                           Commissioner of Indian affairs. Grant, like every honest man in this
                           country, fully believes our debts will and must be paid promptly in coin.
                           The right of suffrage, as a question for the people of colour, is coming
                           round right. They will be no longer considered as being ineligible for
                           office. Such has passed one Congress, by way of amendment to the
                           Constitution, and will be ratified by two-thirds of the members of the
                           different legislative bodies. People at the South are awaking to their
                           interests, and w^ish to have the best men chosen to fill the most

                           colour, made of nature's best stuff. The Pacific Eailway will undoubtedly

                        <p>"We hear many good things of John Bright, his name rings in America just
                           now more than ever. Sometimes we hear it connected wdth Victor Hugo,
                           sometimes with that of Gladstone and many others, and always to his
                           credit, be it spoken. It seems by the papers, he was sent for, abroad
                           even, and long importuned before he would consent to become one of the
                           Queen's Cabinet. So it is in every country, as a general thing, the very
                           man who is least anxious for office, is the most fit for office. Is he
                           also President of the Board of Trade? So we understand it. This uphill
                           business I hope is to be done away with measurably in both countries;

                           our Christian neighbours came in for quite a distance round, of different
                           denominations. Every arrow was put into its quiver, none were seen
                           flying, a happy state of things. None will deny but that there was a
                           heavenly feeling prevalent, and much good done I think. Once in a while a

                        <p>The allusion in the following letter is to the death by an accident, of a

                        <p>Bollin, Michigan, 18-4-69. " C. brought me, just now, two photographs,
                           which Ave have looked upon with a long, earnest, loving look. They
                           contained your little family group. Sweet little N. we looked at the
                           longest. Then came the thought, * More lovely, more beautiful still,
                           now.' The angelic form, how far surpassing the little one laid beneath
                           the sod. Think of her, my precious sister, as she is now. Let thy
                           thoughts dwell upon her iiresent as often as they ponder upon her past,
                           and then look to the future. Think of the time when standing before the
                           eternal throne, a little one will lovingly greet thee, and say, * I was
                           motherless and she cared for me, and was a mother to me, I was hungry and
                           she fed me, I was naked and she clothed me.' It is a joy to have one
                           loved and cherished one gone before thee there, one to bear such
                           testimony. What thou hast done for that dear, motherless child will be an
                           eternal joy to thee ! A bright star in thy crown immortal ! For thee and
                           dear S. and F., this is a very bitter cup, but for the precious child an
                           easy death, a sudden transition, a great joy ! For her, how much better
                           than a lingering sickness — days and nights of suffering and restless
                           agony. Sometimes in our sorrows and trials we are apt to think it was not
                           a Father's hand that gave us the bitter cup, but we can trace the
                           affliction to the sins, or weaknesses, or carelessness of our
                           fellow-beings, and therefore it was or is the harder to bear.</p>
                        <p>"In this case there is no room for any such conclusion. A loving Father's
                           own hand has given you the cup to drink of, and the mourning spirit, I
                           doubt not, will meekly say, ' The cup which my Father hath given me,
                           shall I not drink it? ' Yes ! drink it, dear mourning ones, and the power
                           of Jehovah will change it into a sweeter draught, will transmute it into
                           gold — will transform it into a rich blessing.</p>
                        <p>'* A dear friend of mine had a terrible grief some little time ago. As
                           her daughter lay dying she gave her sweet babe, a week old, to her, and
                           requested her to ' take it home with her and be a mother to it.' The
                           precious treasure was taken right to the heart of its grandmother, and
                           reared with the most tender care. It was a bright sunbeam in the house,
                           the joy and delight of the whole family. When about three years old, a
                           fearful accident cut short its life. The eldest son, a boy of eighteen
                           had put the oil-can in the oven, to take the frost out of it, and
                           carelessly left it there until boiling hot, then recollecting it,
                           hurriedly went to remove it. His little niece, his pet and plaything,
                           came running up to him and clinging to his knees, when her busy prattle
                           was exchanged for a piercing shriek as the bottom fell out of the
                           over-heated can, and the boiling oil descended upon the little upturned
                           face and head. Twenty-four hours of indescribable agony followed, before
                           the spirit was released from the suffering body.</p>
                        <p>"When my friend, R.C., related these particulars to me, a year after they
                           transpired, she added, that if the darling child had died by any other
                           means than through her son's carelessness, she could have borne it
                           better. I comforted her a little by relating the story of the ' Hermit,'
                           in the ' Sequel,' particularly dwelling upon the lines, 'To all but thee
                           in fits he seemed to go, And 'twas my ministry to deal the blow.' I
                           believe it is often really thus, and things look so different to us with
                           our contracted, finite vision, to what they really are in the Divine
                           sight. I have scarcely experienced a trial in my life that I cannot look
                           back upon and recognise as a blessing.</p>
                        <p>"My dear brother and sister, it is an unspeakable consolation to know
                           that a dear Father is watching over us all the time, and that ' He doeth
                           all things well.' The painful tidings of your great loss were handed to
                           me just the evening before I left Chicago. I reached home safely and

                        <p>Hannah Hobbs, writing of attending Indiana Yearly Meeting, and of W.L.
                           meeting herself and friends at the station, goes on to state, '* We had
                           not gone many steps when I perceived a woman Friend coming towards us. I
                           said to W.F., 'She looks like an English Friend.* Just as I uttered it
                           she quickened her steps, and instantly and heartily saluted me; my
                           salutation was no less cordial. It was dear Elizabeth Comstock; she could
                           not see much alteration in me, she said; I could see more in her. She
                           looks well and hearty, and in some way changed, still there is the same
                           expression of countenance. She, with her companion, Rachel Beale, her
                           husband's sister, were likewise staying at W. Lefevre's. E.G. was
                           furnished with a certificate from her meeting in Michigan, to attend, in
                           her ministerial capacity, our Indiana Yearly Meeting, and some meet- ings
                           in the way and on her return home; and her companion, an elder, was also
                           liberated to accompany her. We were quite a company of English Friends,
                           others coming to mingle with us during portions of the Y.M. Thou wilt
                           guess we had a nice time of enjoyment in various ways. When suitable time
                           admitted, E.G. enquired much about thyself and very many others; in
                           return, she gave me all the intelligence she could. She is a remarkable
                           woman. She attended all the sittings of the Y.M., besides Committee
                           meetings, Educational, Tract, and Bible meetings; rose very early in the
                           morniug to make caps and walk before breakfast, mostly sat up to twelve
                           o'clock writing to various friends. She is a most indefatigable
                           individual, doing so much daily, yet not appearing wearied. Her ministry
                           is excellent, so perfect in quoting Scripture, and her illustrations are
                           beautiful; the manner of her delivery is so good, clear and distinct;
                           whatever meeting she attended, she had something appropriate to say. At
                           the Educational Meeting she was well qualified to speak, so well
                           grounded; at the Tract and Bible meetings she was ready to impart
                           interesting facts of a pleasing and edifying character. Whenever she
                           spoke she riveted the attention of the company. Again in the family
                           circle, dear Elizabeth was so bright, I may say for one and all, her
                           company was enjoyable; she was several times engaged in addressing us, in
                           a religious capacity, something for every one. Some- times later on in
                           the evenings, we had repeating poetry, reminding us of our English
                           cap-verse, which</p>
                        <p>is not a custom here On the evening of First-day, a large company of
                           young people were at meeting, in accordance with the request of E. C. Her
                           testimony was sound, comprehensive and striking. She described the
                           Creation in a most beautiful manner, and repeated a few lines composed by
                           an English author on the subject — her manner was truly sublime, and the
                           greatest attention was observed by the large company. I have heard many
                           remark, both Friends and others, how wonderful are her descriptive
                           powers, and what a great knowledge she possesses of Scripture Truth The
                           time for separation had arrived — we bade farewell to one another, dear
                           E. C. commending us to the continued care of our Heavenly Father, who she
                           believed would be our Comforter and Caretaker during our pilgrimage
                           here."</p>
                        <p>From Farmington, N.Y., 22-9-1871, E.L.C. writes:— "Ohio Yearly Meeting
                           has been very interesting. We have adopted the 'Western' proposition for
                           a General Conference of all the Yearly Meetings, and appointed a
                           Committee of one of each sex from each Quarterly Meeting, and six from
                           the body of the Yearly Meeting, to attend the first Conference to be held
                           in New York in the sixth month next year. I am sorry London will not
                           unite with us. I think all the Yearly Meetings on this Continent will,
                           except Philadelphia. I mailed you a report of our General Meeting here.
                           Iowa, Indiana, Western, Ohio, New York, and North Carolina hold these
                           General Meetings, and seasons of wonderful out-pouring of the Holy Spirit
                           they are thought to be. Great accessions to our numbers follow them
                           every- where. Indiana's report last year showed an increase of 1,760 to
                           their number during the year."</p>
                        <p>Writing from New York, 29-11-1871, E.L.C. says :— Two nights, one day and
                           a half, spent in travelling unfit me for doing much to-day. This evening
                           we go to a prayer meeting to pray for an especial blessing upon the
                           coming General Meeting, which is to com- mence to-morrow. I wish you
                           could attend one of these meetings. They are very enjoyable, and to you
                           they would seem very extraordinary. Imagine a thousand people gathered
                           together (as they were in Poughkeepsie) in a Presbyterian Church, to hold
                           something like a Yearly Meeting, without any queries, minutes, or
                           business of any kind. A presiding officer, called a chairman or
                           president, sits at the head of the meeting. His business is to control or
                           guide matters a little in a quiet waj'. If any unsuitable offerings are
                           presented, to check them. If several rise at a time he prevents disorder
                           by remark- ing aloud, ' John Brown has the floor, wait a minute Joseph !
                           ' Then he will call upon Joseph next that he may also have a chance.
                           Sometimes seven or eight will be on their feet together, and the chairman
                           takes care that they each one shall have an opportunity to speak in turn.
                           Sometimes five or six prayers will be offered in rapid succession. We do
                           not rise in prayer, but avoid the confusion this would produce by bowing
                           the head reverentially, and closing the eyes. We expect J.H.D., S.F.S.,
                           W.W., C.E.T., and many others of our ablest ministers will be present at
                           this General Meeting, at Brooklyn, which will probably last near a week.
                           Brooklyn is a city of near 400,000, almost like a continuation of this
                           city; only the East River between them, which is crossed by steam
                           ferries. There are eight ferries from different wharves. Some of these
                           start one every minute, some every two, and some every five minutes, some
                           ten, so they keep on all day, and half the night, eighteen hours out of
                           the twenty- four at least.</p>
                        <p>At the commencement of every sitting of these General Meetings, after two
                           or three opening prayers, one of our ablest ministers usually preaches a
                           good sermon of varying length, from thirty to forty or fifty minutes,
                           then the voices of the multitude are heard, and thirty, forty, fifty, or
                           sixty follow in brief experi- ences, or prayers, or ejaculatory
                           confessions of the Saviour's name before men. There w^as no previous
                           arrangement, no rule laid down, but I observed that it resolved itself
                           into this sometimes; at others three or four rather brief, pointed
                           sermons would be delivered, and then a shorter time for confession.
                           Occasionally, the Pastor of the Church would give us a brief accept- able
                           address entirely in unison with the burden of the meeting at the time.
                           Now and then, if a tedious, prosy speaker got the floor, and could not '
                           hold his audience,' a gentle hint to be brief would be given. In the
                           event of that failing to produce effect, he would be informed by the
                           'chair!' that many others w^ere waiting, desiring an opportunity,
                           &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>"I have attended five of these General Meetings, and five of the biennial
                           Sabbath School Conferences, and it has been beautiful to see the good
                           order, the complete harmony, and the delightful variety in unity of the
                           whole. Indiana led off in the General Meeting movement, Iowa followed,
                           then other Yearly Meetings, until all are now holding them, except
                           Philadelphia, Canada, and New England. The latter will adopt them next
                           year, no doubt. These meetings are usually followed by large accessions
                           to our meetings, our Society I mean."</p>
                        <p>MoUifij Lenawee Co., Michigan, 8-4-1872. . . . . " I stayed in Rochester
                           two weeks, and upon leaving that city, spent two days at Clifton Springs
                           Water Cure, forty miles east of Rochester, with Sarah F. Smiley. We two
                           received a very cordial invitation to go and stay a few weeks there and
                           rest, and hold a few meetings with the patients, of whom there are 200.
                           S. stayed there two weeks, and enjoyed the quiet rest very much. The
                           result of the General Meeting in Rochester has been to stir up the few
                           Friends there, and the citizens, to try to get subscriptions for building
                           a large Friends' meeting house in a central locality, and they have
                           written urgently to us (John and me) to go and reside there, and help to
                           build up a large meeting. ... J. has replied that we could not leave our
                           home entirely, but may go and labour among them a few months in the year.
                           I have added to his letter that ' my minute for service in New York and
                           New England is not yet completed, and may occupy me for some months
                           longer. When that service is accomplished, should way open clearly, it
                           would be a pleasure to sojourn among them for awhile.' I attend our
                           Monthly Meeting held here on 7th day, a Missionary Meeting in the
                           evening, our regular gathering this morning, and a meeting for seekers
                           after holiness this afternoon."</p>
                        <p>E. L. C. to C. H.</p>
                        <p>Lake Mohonk House, nr. Po'keepsie, N.Y., 12-8-72. "Thy deeply interesting
                           and touching letter of the 24th ult. came to hand two hours ago, and has
                           awakened my tender sympathy for thee and dear S., and indeed for your
                           whole family. While reading it I have been again reminded of my favourite
                           lines, "'I cannot always trace the way, Where Thou, Almighty One, dost
                           move, But I can always, always say. That God is Love I trust, my dear
                           sister, that in all thy trials, severe though they have been, thou hast
                           been able in confiding, child-like trust, to adopt this language. There
                           is great consolation to me in the hour of trial, in a sense that nothing
                           can happen to any of us, but in the permissive wisdom of Him, ' who doeth
                           all things well.' Grief and sorrow dispensed or permitted by Him, cannot
                           hurt us, but sanctified and blessed by Him, must prove mentally a
                           blessing. Already when thou wast writing to me, thou wast able, my dear
                           sister, to begin to count the blessings resulting from the sorrows. The
                           development in your dear children of the sympathies and affections, dear
                           M.'s motherly care for her little brother removed from thy tender
                           guardianship, when so greatly needing it. The 'life of self-renouncing
                           love' thus early practised, must all be ranked among the silver linings
                           to these dark clouds. The change of air benefiting all of them, was also
                           a blessing. And now, my dear C, feeling that in the past a Father's love
                           'hath stayed the rough wind, in the day of His East wind,' can we not
                           trust Him with all the future, and leave our all in His hands, and at His
                           all-wise disposal?... J. and I have been toiling in the heat, visiting
                           prisoners, sick, poor and afflicted people for some weeks; and receiving
                           a kind and pressing invitation to come here and rest a week or two in
                           this cool, calm, romantic spot, we felt free to accept it. Albert K.
                           Smiley is Sarah's brother. Two or three years ago he purchased 180 acres
                           here, wild, mountainous land. He has beautified and adorned it, built a
                           large boarding-house, and made it a very pleasant place of summer resort.
                           I enclose a picture or two, showing something of the picturesque scenery
                           by which we are surrounded. ... I hope I may hear from thee again very
                           soon, for I shall be anxious to hear how S. gets up his strength, and how
                           thou art after thy long time of nursing thy dear husband and child."</p>

                        <p>"I have just been attending a very interesting General Meeting, and w^ill
                           try to give a little outline of this one as a specimen. Meeting commenced
                           in a large Friends' Meeting House in Salem, Ohio, seventy miles south of
                           Cleveland, at 2 p.m.. Sixth-day. The Com- mittees of Ohio Yearly Meeting
                           and Salem Quarterly Meeting met for consultation and preliminary arrange-
                           ments earlier in the day. I am upon the Yearly Meeting's Committee. About
                           twenty-five Friends on Committees present. It was decided to hold three
                           meetings per day, at ten, two, and seven o'clock. In addition to these,
                           at the request of and others, an extra meeting for enquirers and seekers,
                           and for con- ference, &amp;c., was arranged for 8.S0 a.m.</p>
                        <p>"Considerable anxiety was manifested by the Committee on account of the
                           approaching General Meeting, because in the to^-n of Salem were three
                           meetings of those who pass by the name of Friends — Hicksite, Wilburite,
                           and Gurneyite; or Unitarian, Old School, and New School Quakers, as some
                           call them, Hicksite there being the larger body and ours the smallest of
                           the three. I was rather uneasy when the meeting gathered to find no other
                           co-labourers from a distance except, However, he proved equal to the
                           emergency and preached an able sermon for three-quarters of an hour,
                           after I had offered a prayer. I then spoke upon the same subject, the
                           Divinity of Christ, and the power of our blessed faith to uphold and
                           sustain in the most afflictive dispensations of life and in the solemn
                           hour of death. Eight or nine short prayers were offered, and two others
                           spoke briefly. Our meeting in the evening was much larger, the stores
                           being closed, the shop-keepers, teachers, students, &amp;c., were at
                           liberty to attend. Salvation through faith was dwelt upon, and many
                           voices spoke a few words out of the abundance of the heart, after and I
                           had each preached over half-an-hour. These two meetings each held over
                           two hours. At 8.30 a.m. on Seventh-day a small gathering met — some
                           prayers, some confessions, some questions asked and answered, some
                           thanksgiving and praise. At ten o'clock a larger number gathered than on
                           the previous day. , withjadded power, preached near an hour. I followed
                           for half-an-hour; several prayers offered, four in succession, by others.
                           In the after- noon , one of our greatest ministers from Indiana, was
                           added to our staff of labourers. We rejoiced to welcome him. He occupied
                           half-an-hour or more, and I think we were all sorry when he sat down. On
                           First- day morning two or three other labourers joined us. The beautiful
                           variety we have in the ministry is very striking."</p>
                        <p>E. L. C. to C. H.</p>
                        <p>Waterville, Maine, 27 -2-1 87 S. . . . . "For four days we have been '
                           snow- bound ' in the village of Unity. No cars could run. They had no
                           telegraph wires, and we seemed shut out from the world. We had very good
                           meetings there; just the people in the village attended. Friends two or
                           three miles out could not get there. Some had travelled fifty or sixty
                           miles to attend the General Meeting, some 150. They put up with Friends
                           two or three miles from Unity for the night. Before morning eighteen
                           inches of snow fell. The country was hilly, and the wind roared, almost a
                           hurricane; the snow drifted so much that in places it was sixteen or
                           seven- teen feet deep, and many Friends for several days could not move
                           either homeward or meeting-ward. It was very trying for them. Yesterday
                           morning the sky and clouds looked ominous of more snow. E.H., M.B., E.J.,
                           and other leading men took counsel to- gether, and came to the conclusion
                           that it was best to * cut through,' or they might be kept there another
                           week. So preparations were made ; oxen, men with shovels, horses and
                           sleighs, we moved slowly and solemnly out of Unity, like a funeral
                           procession, except for the merriment amongst us. There were seven sleighs
                           in our caravan, nine went a few hours earlier over a few miles of the
                           same road. Sixteen teams altogether. The men went ahead, the women in the
                           rear. Thus we went nine miles in six or seven hours. Had it not been for
                           the cavalcade that went on ahead, it would have taken much longer. We are
                           now at a hotel w^here we have been staying for the night en route for
                           Winthrop, where we hope to arrive in season for their Monthly Meeting,
                           and the series of meetings to commence on Seventh-day next. My present
                           com- panion is a pleasant young Friend, A.C., from Sing- Sing, N.Y. I
                           hope my dear J. will join me again in the Spring, about the time of New
                           York Yearly Meeting, which is to be held in Rochester this year."</p>
                        <p>Writing from Philadelphia, in Fourth month, 1873, E.L.C. says, "I am very
                           much interested in the 'Higher Christian Life.' To me there is sweet rest
                           in the thought that all responsibility, all care, all dependence are
                           given up to Him who careth for us. I can trust Him with my present, for
                           my past and future, knowing that no ill from Him can come to me, and that
                           all must work together for good to them that love Him, and to me
                           personally.</p>
                        <p>"With regard to present trials, and all yet to come, I can now say,</p>
                        <quote>
                           <p>' I would rather walk in the dark with God,</p>
                           <p>Than walk alone in the light; I would rather walk by faith with
                              Him,</p>
                           <p>Than walk alone by sight.'</p></quote>
                        <p>"My dear C. is living this life of trust and rest, and she is tranquilly
                           and peacefully happy. Do you hear much about this higher life in England
                           now? Here God is working wonderfully, stirring up all the churches, and
                           there is a general awakening in every branch of the church almost, to a
                           sense that we are living far below our privileges, and meetings are being
                           everywhere held especially for those who seek 'a closer walk with
                           God.'</p>
                        <p>"In some places, meetings for seekers after holiness are held three times
                           a week among Friends, besides our regular meetings."</p>
                        <p>Writing from New Bedford, on the 8-4-73, after referring to the trials of
                           some very dear to her, E.L.C. continues, "How 3 v^er, least this, with
                           all other burdens, upon Him who careth for us, and for all, trusting that
                           He will overrule all our mistakes for good. It is an exceedingly precious
                           promise to me that *all things shall work together for good to them that
                           love the Lord.' So I wait and watch for the good.</p>
                        <p>"So our dear friend Joseph Theobald is gone ! His dear wife was one of
                           the kind friends of our childhood. He was the same. Our dear father loved
                           him much. I do not grieve over his death, nor over Cousin William's, I
                           have a sort of sense that they are nearer to us now than when living on
                           earth so far from us. Didst thou read ^ The Awakening? ' I think I sent
                           it to thee some tinie ago. I believe in it, and also in 'Gates Ajar.' . .
                           . Truly 'length of days' is not now a blessing as in the days of Moses,
                           when 'the first com- mandment with promise was given forth.' . . . Our
                           Manchester (Maine) Meeting was a very good and a very interesting one. C.
                           and her cousin attended, and enjoyed it very much. J.H.D. and S.F.S. had
                           previous engagements which prevented their attendance. From Manchester we
                           went to North Berwick, and had a good General Meeting there, thence to
                           North Weare, N.H., and had the crowning meeting there. W.W. was Mer-
                           cnrius (Acts xiv., 12) in both the last-named. He is now a powerful
                           Gospel preacher and a great revivalist . . I was somewhat startled in
                           Manchester Meeting when I saw my dear C. rise and sing a sweet hymn.
                           Immediately afterwards a Friend knelt, asking the Lord's blessing upon
                           the various exercises, alluding especially to the ' sweet singing.' This
                           was done again and again. The ministers would occasionally refer to it.
                           W. W. said ' Amen ' frequently, and once immediately followed C. with '
                           That's what I call true Quaker singing.' He then quoted Barclay upon *
                           singing, praying, and preaching,' placing them all on the same footing,
                           when done ' with the spirit and understanding.' Some Friends came to her
                           after meeting and spoke very encouragingly to her. One minister pressed
                           through the crowd, saying, ' I want to speak to this sweet little singer
                           in Israel.' Most were kind and approving — one contrariwise said, ' My
                           dear, if thou feels like doing something for thy Saviour, would it not be
                           better to sjjeak like thy mother, instead of singing?' C. replied, 'It
                           will be many years before I can speak like my mother.' .... There is a
                           young minister risen up amongst us, who is a great man, and doing good
                           work for his Lord, Rufus King. He is twenty-nine years of age. When a
                           poor boy of thirteen, he was 'bound out' to a very cruel, hard master in
                           North Carolina, who promised to clothe, feed, and educate him, but,
                           instead of this, he made him work very hard, and often cruelly beat him.
                           He was driven to his work daily with the negroes, and received short
                           allowance of food like them, three pounds of coarse beef a week, and some
                           Indian meal, and never went to school a day. He endured this for five
                           years, then ran away. Soon after he was pressed into the rebel army,
                           refused to fight, and suffered cruel persecution for a year-and-a-half,
                           then deserted, and after perils and hardships almost incredible, and
                           protracted, he made his way into Indiana, and there first mingled with
                           Friends. There is an innocent simplicity about him, perfectly charming.
                           He rose in a meeting of 1,000, and commenced, 'Friends, I don't know
                           much, and I come from a part of the country where they don't know much,
                           and what little I do know I sometimes find it hard to tell. Five years
                           ago, I did not know how to read or write my name. Five years ago, I did
                           not know that the earth was round, but Friends, before I could read and
                           write my name, and before I knew that the earth was round, I knew that
                           the Lord Jesus Christ had washed away my sins.' This commenced a sermon,
                           which enchained his audience for near an hour. ... I have been at our
                           dear friend Joseph Grinnell's a week. In a few days I go to Providence,
                           and after a week there to Philadelphia, where my address will be for
                           three weeks at the pleasant home of Elizabeth H. Farnum, 713, Arch
                           Street. After getting through in Phila- delphia I hope to attend the New"
                           York Yearly Meeting, to be held this year at Rochester. I pick up C. and
                           her baby en route near Albany, and go home with them. After a few weeks'
                           rest my husband will probably return with me to Rochester, N.Y., for
                           awhile. How terrible the loss of the Atlantic steamer ! The hearts of our
                           people have been wonderfully stirred with sympathy for the poor
                           sufferers. The whole trouble, and agony, and anguish in this case, and
                           the terrible loss of life seem to have originated in reckless
                           carelessness. . . . Indignation against the Captain runs high just
                           now."</p>

                        <p>Rollin, 29-6-73- "By a young woman living near Philadelphia, who was
                           expecting shortly to visit Darlington, and who said she was acquainted
                           with thee, I sent two books. One for thy dear F., ' The Record of a Happy

                           eighteen steps ! It was well that they were well carpeted, and that no
                           bones were broken in the rapid descent into the hall below. I was much
                           bruised, but I am thankful to say that otherwise I am uninjured, and the
                           bruises are nearly well now. This accident occurred in our kind friends'
                           Robert and Susanna Howland's house at Union Springs. I had a complete
                           rest, chiefly in bed, for near a week afterwards. This rest did me a
                           great deal of good, my former malady being benefited thereby. The bruises
                           acted as a counter irritant, and have also been beneficial. I hope our
                           dear aunt E.S. has entirely recovered from her fall downstairs. R. is
                           nearly well again. Very singular that we three should all be suffering
                           near the same time from the same cause, in such remote parts of the earth
                           ! I hope all the rest of our friends will take warning by us, and 'walk
                           circum- spectly !'.... Farewell, my dear brother and sister. Write soon.

                           visiting our native land if our lives are spared until next year. As to
                           the ti?ne of our visit, we should wish to be guided by your convenience.
                           What season of the year would suit you best to receive us? Have you any
                           choice ? C. says she ' should so like to be in England when the Spring
                           flowers are in bloom.' Then we both think it would be so nice to be with
                           you in the summer, and escape the excessive heat, the flies and
                           mosquitoes. I turn longingly to the cosy winter evenings, when we can sit
                           and sew or knit around the 02:&gt;en fire that we can see, while S. reads
                           to us. So w^e leave the choice of time with you as to seasons. To me it
                           seems the American Autumn carries the palm, in its abundance of fruit and
                           profusion of rich, varied foliage. The other three seasons I prefer in
                           England. Baby lies sleeping on the bed while I write. When C. was tele-
                           graphed to come to me she left her little boy with his father's parents.
                           She could not suitably leave her C.L., and brought her with her. We get
                           along very well with her, only we have some fears that the great
                           attention and petting she receives from so many ladies may spoil her.
                           Some of them invite her to ride out with them — she has been out twice
                           to-day driving in the carriages with the ladies. She is a sweet, winsome
                           little maid, with blue eyes, rosy cheeks, and flaxen hair, and a perfect
                           blonde in complexion, but she begins to manifest a pretty strong will of
                           her own, and to show that she is not all angel. ... I long to introduce
                           her to her cousins at Darlington. I think F. will be delighted with her,
                           and she will be much pleased to have a little hoy the age of her brother
                           to play with. How pleasant it will be for dear C. also to be introduced
                           to her cousins, whom she has never seen. M.C. and C. will be very good
                           friends. Now that I have really concluded to go to England if my life be
                           spared and health permit, it seems long to wait until spring or summer.
                           My friend H. W. S. goes on the 15th of this month by the * Philadelphia,'
                           steamer from that city. Have you seen her husband, R. P. S.? He has been
                           in England for some time for the benefit of his health. He is a
                           higher-life preacher. The physicians order him to stop preaching or he
                           will die of softening of the brain. He replies that he must preach as
                           long as he lives and can do so. I have repeatedly been advised to stop
                           preaching for awhile, for I am wearing myself out. I think of resting in
                           England a few months with my dear relatives, and doing but little
                           preaching com- paratively, during that time. H. W. S. takes her children
                           with her I think. Little R. is a lovely little darling. When about three
                           years old, one morning in family worship, they had read the chapter about
                           turning water into wine. The next day, there was a drunken man making a
                           great noise in the street, near their door. The child looked in
                           astonishment and horror. In answer to her questions, some one told her he
                           Avas a naughty man who had drunk too much wine. She looked very serious
                           and thoughtful, and in her little prayer before going to bed that night,
                           she said, * Dear Jesus, don't make any more wine, please don't, if the
                           naughty mans does tell Thee to.'</p>
                        <p>8rd 11th mo. I have just been having a talk with Dr. F., who strongly
                           advises me to sail for England without delay. He says this month is a
                           good one for the voyage. He tells me that if I do not take a change and
                           rest, and that very soon, I shall break quite down, and never rally
                           again. With said voyage and a year's rest, he thinks I may live to a good
                           old age, and enjoy good health. I must write to J. at once, and try to
                           arrange to sail with H. W. S., if there is room, and I can find the
                           means. So you may see us much sooner than you expected. I will write
                           again in a few days, D.Y. Dearest love to S. and the dear children."</p>
                        <p>Our dear sister with her daughter and little grand- daughter, sailed from
                           Philadelphia, in the "Indiana" on the 27th of November, and landed safely
                           in Liverpool on the 9th of December. Thej' were met by her brother, S.
                           H., and travelled to Darlington same day, where a happy reunion took
                           place.</p>

                        <p>AFTER a quiet rest in the North of England, occasionally broken by large
                           meetings in Friends' Meeting-houses and other places of worship to which
                           she was often invited, E.L.C. visited relatives and Friends in the South
                           — and towards the end of April crossed to Ireland to attend Dublin Yearly
                           Meeting, accompanied by her sister. Just a week after leaving England,
                           the latter was summoned home by telegram, on account of the illness and
                           subsequent death of a beloved daughter. There are references to this sad
                           event in the following letters.</p>

                        <p>Dublin, 8-5-1874. "I mailed thee a postal card to-day, not being able to
                           do better then, but now, having half-an-hour to spare, I resume the pen.
                           The Yearly Meeting i^roper closed with its eighth session about 2 p.m.
                           yesterday. They had rather aimed at concluding the previous evening, but
                           adjourned to have a short session tomorrow morning. I took the
                           opportunity of this short session to pay a visit of one hour to the Men's
                           Meeting. I wish thou hadst been with me; L.G. accompanied me. I had felt
                           some little drawing tow^ards this ser- vice for two or three days, but it
                           did not mature in my mind until Fourth-day night. The proposal was
                           received with overwhelming approval by the Women's Meeting, and (I have
                           since been told) by the Men's also, and that it was at the very right
                           time, for just then they were discussing the liquor question, and I blew
                           a blast against the three great sins that have been such curses to
                           Christian lands in this our day, viz.. Intemper- ance, Licentiousness,
                           and War. I spoke thirtj'-five or forty minutes, and offered a short
                           prayer. Then follow^ed a true, warm-hearted Irish welcome, so much
                           approval w^ith my visit and message as almost over- whelmed me. This
                           occupied fifteen minutes at least. Last evening a meeting was held for
                           young Friends at their own request, and they were the chief speakers. I
                           did not attend this, as the closing session of the Meeting on Ministry
                           and Oversight, held after the close of the Yearly Meeting, and I felt
                           weary. I was expecting to go out to Moyallen with J.M.R., when, at the
                           close of an excellent meeting, J.G.R. announced that he had 7iot had the
                           opportunity of consulting me, but that it was the urgent request of some
                           of the earnest young Friends that I would meet them in the Committee Room
                           at the close of this sitting, also that I would meet them this evening at
                           seven o'clock for a continuation of the same kind of meeting as we had
                           the other evening, a sort of fellowship or conference meeting. Also that
                           a very urgent and particular request had been made for an appointed
                           meeting for the public in this house on First-day evening. Then all eyes
                           turned to me for a reply. R.W.D. had previously handed me a pencilled
                           note, querying ' Ought we not to have another meeting this evening '?
                           Though I felt empty, and poor, and weak, I did not feel at liberty to say
                           ' no ! ' and to close a door that I felt the Lord had opened, and after a
                           brief silent prayer, I gave my assent to said meetings being appointed,
                           if the Friends thought it best, and the other ministers felt like uniting
                           in them. I also felt it right to appoint a meeting for to-morrow at
                           twelve o'clock for mothers and Christian women. So you see I have my
                           hands full. A letter from dear H.W.S. to-day urges me to go to London on
                           Fifth-day next, and appointments are given out for several meetings for
                           her and me jointly in Stoke Newington Friends' Meeting House. Notices are
                           issued in both our names. I have given up Bessbrook and Moyallen for the
                           present. They expect to have a General Meet- ing in that vicinity soon,
                           and I have promised to attend it (D.y.) if it is not in the Seventh
                           month, which I hope to spend with dear L Now, my dear sister, do not
                           think that because left till last it is the least thought of, thou and
                           thy trial and thy precious child. I have thought of thee very often, and
                           with much tender sympathy. The report in thy letter we all thought quite
                           as encouraging as we could look for. I trust the doctor's hopes are being
                           realized, and that the worst is past."</p>

                        <p>Parkfield Upper Clajjton, 14-5-1874. "I arrived here safely after a
                           tolerably comfortable voyage and journey. B.P., her mother, and sister
                           accompanied me on board the boat. M.E. and daughters also came to see me
                           off. With so good an escort, of course we all and our baggage were well
                           looked after, and J.E. placed us and our things safely in J.B.B.'s and
                           S.A.'s son's hands before he left us. These kind friends w^ere waiting on
                           the platform on our arrival at Euston Square Station Thy kind letter
                           awaited me here on my arrival. . . I am glad you have another doctor as
                           well as an experienced nurse. I most sincerely hope and pray that his
                           efforts and skill may be blessed, and that your precious child may be
                           restored to you. . . . I think very much of you in your sorrow, and pray
                           that you may be sustained under it, and blessed in it R.W.D. was to be at
                           Grange Monthly Meeting to-day (near Belfast, I think). He expected to
                           spend next First-day at Leominster, with J.G.R. and party, en route for
                           London Yearly Meeting. His health has been a little benefited by his
                           quiet rest at Willow Park. ... He expects to sail for America immediately
                           after the Yearly Meeting. seems full of anxiety about the coming
                           solemnity, \qvj fearful of it not going off just right. He expressed this
                           to me during the few minutes we were together, and spoke of the necessity
                           of dwelling deep and being frequent and earnest in prayer. I have faith
                           to believe that we shall have a good Yearly Meeting, if we pray for the
                           spirit of the Lord and do not quench it, but let it have free course and
                           abound. I am very thankful that the responsibility rests with the Lord
                           and not with me. . . . A very interesting young man is putting up here,
                           Theophilus Waldemeier, one of whom I have often heard Eli and Sybil Jones
                           speak as a missionary to Syria from Switzerland, or some European
                           country. He adopted Friends' views without any knowledge of our Society.
                           He has made known to some Friends his great desire to attend the Yearly
                           Meeting. Some are fearful of opening their doors, &amp;c., and timid
                           about precedent. My fears run in a different channel. I should fear worse
                           results from one refusal than from one hundred permissions given."</p>

                           that he was appreciated. (' Tell it not in Gath.') It was all right also
                           not to let that sort of thing go too far, and for Henry Pease to remind
                           Friends that they were not in the House of Commons, &amp;c., and to
                           maintain the dignity and solemnity of the Yearly Meeting. I hope the

                           them at times, and yet I would not be absent from my dear sister at this
                           crisis. We are having a pleasant, quiet time here. L. came on Seventh-day
                           and tarried until Third; we three sisters much enjoyed each others'
                           company. The Ayton group joined us yesterday so we are all together now.
                           The weather is delightful. We all went down to the beach this morning
                           about nine o'clock, and stayed three or four hours, the children greatly
                           enjoying working in the sand with spades and little pails, &amp;c., and
                           doing their part towards fulfilling the ancient prophecy, ' Every valley

                        <p>Writing to her sister of the Sabbath School Confer- ence in Darlington,
                           under date 6-8-74, E.L.C. says, The Conference seems to have given
                           general satisfaction. I did not attend yesterday p.m. at the closing
                           session, nor at the nine a.m. one, feeling that the other three in one
                           day were enough for me, viz., meeting for worship at ten, conference from
                           twelve to two (during which I was summoned to the desk to give an object
                           lesson with magnets), and the evening meeting in Bondgate Chapel.</p>
                        <p>"In the latter I spoke twelve minutes. H.W.S. offered prayer at the
                           commencement, M.S. near the close. The other speakers were A. P.
                           president, J.S.F., W.W., W.S.L., M.S., E.B., James H.B., and two or three
                           more Friends, followed by two of the pastors of the Darlington churches.
                           Two others were invited to speak, but declined, and gave as their reason
                           a wish to</p>
                        <p>' give their time to the American speakers.' made a little mistake (to my
                           mind) in dwelling entirely upon woman's sphere and woman's duties in the
                           kitchen, at the wash-tub and ironing board, cooking, mending, staying at
                           home to make the home comfortable for her lord and master. M.L., who sat
                           near me and near the speaker, looked infinitely disgusted. She did not
                           reply to him, but I did. My indignation was aroused, and I could not keep
                           silence. I told the audience that a woman had a mind to cultivate and a
                           soul to be saved as well as a man, and that if they wished the next
                           generation of men to be better than the present, the women must be
                           educated and elevated. . . There is to be a meeting for ladies only, S.S.
                           teachers mainly, at nine a.m. to-morrow, by the request of J.C., from
                           Birmingham, and two or three other earnest teachers. They wrote a note to
                           me, before giving out the notice, to ask me to meet with them. I
                           consented, and the notice was read from the President's chair. At 11.30,
                           J.G. and I have a public meeting for such as are remaining and wish to
                           attend; also, a meeting in the evening for servants, waiters, and
                           cab-drivers, &amp;c., who have waited upon Friends during the Conference.
                           These have received very respectful letters of invitation to a tea party
                           at six p.m., and meeting after."</p>
                        <p>Extracts from two short addresses of E.L.C.'s, given at the Conference,
                           are subjoined: —</p>
                        <p>"Looking at Christ as a Teacher, our example and model, I think we find
                           His object lessons exceedingly simple in illustration. In teaching the
                           multitudes and common people. He usually spoke to them by illustration
                           and by incident, such as, 'A sower went forth to sow,' when it might be
                           they could see the sower scattering the seed; the woman kneeling down,
                           and hiding her leaven in the meal; the builders erecting the foundation
                           of a house — one having chosen a good foundation, and the other a poor
                           one, and the result of building on a rock or on sand. I think in these
                           object lessons the teachers would have great power over their scholars,
                           especially over the poor and ignorant.</p>
                        <p>"On one occasion, while I was out on a mission, and visiting the military
                           hospitals, I came upon a General as I walked from one hospital to
                           another. I went within the reach of his voice, and found the General
                           haranguing his troops the evening before an engagement. He gave them the
                           following instructions : — ' Fire low; don't fire over the heads of your
                           enemies.' Sabbath school teachers, fire low!"</p>

                        <p>At another sitting of the Conference she said, My husband is a shepherd,
                           and has a large flock to tend; where there is good pasture the sheep
                           never wander away, but if bad, no matter how high or strong the fence,
                           the lambs will escape, and the sheep will either break through or jump
                           over the fences. On the other hand, if the pasture be good, they will all
                           find their way into the enclosure. I think this will apply spiritually.
                           And I am bound to express my conviction that many of your meetings would
                           be far more profitable and useful, but for the way in which the Holy
                           Spirit's influences are often restrained and kept down. 1 have heard
                           great preaching ability in some of your schools. But, on entering the
                           Friends' meetings, we come into a different atmosphere. Silence is the
                           order of the day, and Friends, I fear, only prove them- selves as so many
                           dead weights, instead of living stones. When I have called attention to
                           this circum- stance, the reply has mostly been — that it requires a
                           different gift to speak in the meeting-house from the qualification
                           necessary in the school. I don't believe it. Much of the ability which is
                           felt to be an acquisition in school, would not be unsuitable in the
                           Friends' meetings. I find that our English women are too much given to
                           keeping silence; and how few have we heard during this Conference ! The
                           women defer too much to the men, and shirk their responsibilities; and
                           the men, it is interesting to observe, are quite willing to let them.
                           Where the men have so much to say and the women so little, I am not
                           astonished that but little is accomplished. Why do not our dear sisters
                           take their proper places, and use the gifts that God has given them
                           ?"</p>
                        <p>E.L.C. had been an earnest teetotaller from early- life. The folloAving
                           is part of an address she delivered in Devonshire House Friends' Meeting
                           House, during this visit to her native land: —</p>
                        <p>"I remember when I was a very little girl in England, I used to learn
                           some lines from one of Cowper's poems, which I admired very greatly
                           indeed. They began, ' Slaves cannot breathe in England,' and went on to
                           show that the very moment they set foot on English soil, that moment they
                           were free. Now after being away from England twenty years, I return, and
                           one of the first things I hear is, ' There are 600,000 slaves in
                           England.' I say that it is a remarkable thing; but what has become of the
                           truth of Cowper's lines, that we used so very much to like to learn, and
                           that used to make us rejoice so much — that there w^ere no slaves in
                           England, but that all men here were free? And then I am told that the
                           600,000 are slaves of drink, to the bondage of custom, of fashion, and of
                           liquor. Another thing I have been told, on very high authority, is that
                           the people of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland spent in
                           the year 1873, £133,500,000 sterling for intoxicating drinks. I could not
                           have credited it, I had not had it on good authority, and if it had not
                           been put in black and white before me — so much for the excise, so much
                           for the customs, so much for the malt, and so forth. The revenue to the
                           country being £30,000,000 out of the £133,500,000 that you drink up. In
                           1834, the British people paid £20,000,000 sterling to free their slaves.
                           In 1873, they paid £30,000,000 to the Government revenue for the liberty
                           to make slaves. When I was talking to a gentleman a few days ago, and
                           saying what a fearful thing it was, and how I wished that every drop of
                           liquor could be sunk into the bottom of the Atlantic, he said, ' The
                           British Government must inevitably collapse in a case like that.' But, oh
                           ! what do we get in return for that revenue? — Criminals, paupers and
                           prisoners. It is the same in your country as it is in mine, probably
                           worse. I have visited 115,000 prisoners in the United States during the
                           last eighteen years, and out of that number 105,000 seemed to have been
                           brought there, either directly or indirectly, through liquor. I have
                           visited the inmates of poor- houses to the number of 75,000, and out of
                           that number it is supposed that 65,000 and more, could trace their
                           poverty and distress, and coming to the poor-house, to the same cause.
                           And now a word with regard to this slavery. If my dear friend, Anna R.
                           Whiting, had been here I am sure she could have described to you scenes
                           that she has witnessed in England, and that her sister in Liverpool has
                           witnessed. She could tell you of scenes something like this : A little
                           boy found dying, his mother away, intoxicated in a public-house, and her
                           only child, with none but dogs for his companions, in his dying hour. Oh
                           ! what terrible slavery must that be ! I have heard A.R.W. tell some of
                           the thrilling scenes that she has witnessed in England, and though I have
                           not seen so much here as she has, yet I can give you a picture of slavery
                           as it was in America some few years ago; I would like to intro- duce you
                           to a young woman, a Quadroon, with her baby, two years old, in her arms.
                           She is about to be put up to the auction-block to be sold. There are
                           crowds of people around who are bidding for the young woman. She takes
                           her child up in her arms and clasps it with an agonising sense that it is
                           about to be separated from her. In a few minutes she is ordered to put
                           down the little girl. She resists. She will not part with her. It is torn
                           from her arms, and set aside by some hard-hearted people who have no love
                           for it, and the little pleading voice of the child is heard above the
                           tumult crying, ' Mammy, mammy ! take me ! ' And then the overseer, with
                           his heavy whip, threatens the child, and uses rough and brutal language
                           to it. Presently, as the child still cries every now and then, ' Mammy !
                           mammy ! mammy ! ' down comes the heavy whip on the neck, the shoulders,
                           the head, and even the face of the little tender child of two years; but
                           in spite of all, the mother's feeling is there — the mother's strong,
                           loving, tender feeling. That slavery did not and could not destroy the
                           mother's feeling for her child, but the slavery that both your country
                           and mine are groaning under, the slavery of the intoxicating cup, takes
                           away all better feelings, destroys the fatherly instincts and the
                           mother's love, and all the noble and generous feelings in the hearts of
                           its victims.</p>
                        <p>"A dear friend of mine was walking through one of our large towns in the
                           United States, and, as she proceeded, she passed by a group of boys, and
                           heard one of them make use of profane language. She turned quickly, and
                           laid her hand on the head of a little boy about eight years old,
                           half-starved, bare- footed and ragged, and said, ' Is this the little boy
                           I heard swear? ' One of his companions answered jeeringly, ' No, he don't
                           swear; he prays.' And then the mother's heart was drawn out towards the
                           little boy with great sympathy. She found out that the child was all
                           covered with bruises inflicted by his OW' n father's hand, that father
                           being a slave to the intoxicating cup. This slavery had destroyed his
                           manhood and his pity, for his cruelty had been the cause of the death of
                           a good and pious wife, and the little boy said, ' It's so hard to be
                           good, now that mother's dead. Mother died three weeks ago, and now I have
                           no one to pray with me, and to teach me to pray, and to teach me to be
                           good.' Then the question was put by my friend, 'Has thou no father, then
                           ' The little boy said, ' Oh yes, I have a father, but father isn't like
                           mother. Father don't pray. Father drinks and swears and strikes me.' And
                           so the little fellow, having found a sympathetic ear, poured into it the
                           tale of his sorrow. He had not had half enough to eat his appearance
                           showed ; the condition of his clothes was wretched, and his body bore the
                           marks of the ill-usage he had received; and yet that little boy could
                           remember the time when his father was a kind man, when he used to come
                           home sober in the evening; but all that was before he began to drink. The
                           child could also tell how his father had been good to mother before he
                           began to drink, but now mother was dead, and it was 'so hard to be good
                           now!' And then the little boy acknowledged, in answer to my friend's
                           questions, that * father came home drunk last night and beat me cruelly,
                           and this morning sent me away without my breakfast, and I am so hungry.'
                           My friend led him to a baker's shop to give him something to satisfy the
                           cravings of hunger, and when he had made a good meal she said, ' I want
                           thee to take me to the house w^here thy father spends his time and money
                           in drink- ing.' The little boy looked frightened. ' I dare not go,' he
                           said, ' he will whip me if he knows I told you.' She promised not to
                           tell, and then prevailed on the child to walk with her to the place. When
                           he had led her to the house he drew back, afraid of being seen by that
                           father who had once been a kind and good man. The little slave baby was
                           not afraid of her mother, she loved her mother, and the mother loved her.
                           This father, the slave to the drink, had lost his love to his child; he
                           had caused by his brutality the death of the best of wives, and the
                           little boy was afraid of his father seeing him. He just designated his
                           father to my friend, who said to the boy : * Now I want thee to go home,
                           and kneel down and pray to the Lord Jesus, that he will help me to bring
                           thy father home, and soon we will go to your home together.' The little
                           boy said, ' No, he won't come.' ' Oh, yes,' said this praying woman — the
                           trusting child of the Lord — ' he will surely come, for the Lord Jesus
                           has promised that if two of us should ask Him for anything. He will grant
                           it; do thou go home and ask Him, and I will ask Him also.' And the little
                           boy went home, and that servant of the Lord lifted up her heart to her
                           Saviour, asking Him to go with her, and He gave her words to speak to
                           reach the hearts of those who were in the public-house. She went right
                           into it, and saw eight or ten men drinking — it being only eleven o'clock
                           in the morning. She looked steadily at the father of the boy, and said '
                           Is this the man who has a little hungry, neglected, motherless boy at
                           home '? The man looked at her fiercely, and said — ' Who told you about
                           my boy ' .^^ She didn't answer that question, but just replied by a very
                           earnest appeal to the whole company, and preached to them of
                           'righteousness' temperance, and judgment to come.' Some of them trembled,
                           and were filled with fear, and some listened to what she had to say, and
                           many of them, when she had done, went out of that place with her. She
                           then walked along the street with the father of the child, and said ' I
                           want thee to take me to thy home.' ' Oh, no,' he said, ' it's not a fit
                           place for you; there has been no woman in it since the day my dead wife
                           was carried away.' She said, ' I will go with thee.' She prevailed upon
                           him, and they went to his home to- gether, and there, kneeling down in
                           one corner, was the little boy with his hands clasped in prayer. My
                           friend took the profane drinking man by the hand, and said to him, * Thy
                           little boy is kneeling down praying to his Saviour; come, let us kneel
                           down and pray with him.' The father resisted a little while, and said 'I
                           can't remember a prayer — I have never prayed once in my life since I was
                           a child '; but she persuaded him, and presently he knelt down beside her,
                           and there the three were together, the holy praying woman, with the
                           little boy on one side and the father on the other, lifting up her voice
                           to God in x^rayer. And it seemed as though the very heavens were opened,
                           and the prayer w^ent right up to the Mercy Seat, and brought instant
                           blessing down, for in a few minutes that rough man was broken down, and
                           every now and then responded to her prayer by a sincere and earnest
                           'Amen.' When she had finished she said, ' Now I want thee to pray for
                           thyself.' 'Oh ! I cannot,' he said. The tears were flowing, and every now
                           and then a deep sigh escaped him. 'Oh, tell me,' he exclaimed, 'what to
                           say; I do not know what to say'; and then she said to the poor contrite
                           sinner, ' Say, " God be merciful to me a sinner, for Jesus' sake,"' and
                           he repeated the words after her. The prayer of the poor man rose up to
                           heaven that day, and I doubt not the song was heard that had been heard
                           1,800 years previously, only it was of a sinner of a different stamp — '
                           Behold he prayeth,' and there was joy in heaven over a sinner who had
                           repented. When he rose from his knees my friend told him that now it was
                           the will of the Lord that this very hour should be the turning point in
                           his life, that he should leave off ■drinking and gambling, that he should
                           leave off going to the public-houses, and that he should commence praying
                           earnestly, attending the prayer-meeting and the place of worship; and
                           before she left the city, she heard that he had been six times to the
                           prayer- meeting or place of worship, and that he had asked for the
                           prayers of the congregation in the Methodist meeting; and we heard later
                           still that he was continuing to hold out steadily, and being a skilful
                           mechanic was earning sixteen shillings a day — a little more perhaps in
                           the middle of summer and a little less in the middle of winter. What a
                           pity that such a one should have been spending his time and money in the
                           alehouse and ginshop ! His little boy was now well fed, clothed, and
                           going to school; the man had joined the Methodist Church, and was
                           rejoicing in his Saviour, in the sense that his sins were forgiven; and
                           he was a happy man^ looking forward in the hope of meeting the beloved
                           wife, whom he had treated with such great cruelty, in that better land
                           beyond the grave. Which slavery is the worst — that which separates
                           families but still leaves the loving feeling in the heart of the mother
                           and child, or that which brutalises the father, and takes away all the
                           love of his heart and all his interest in his wife and child? I think we
                           may say, without using strong language, the curse of these two nations,
                           America and Great Britain, is strong drink. The two greatest nations upon
                           the face of the earth, the two in which are to be found the most schools,
                           the most Bibles, the most places of worship, and probably the most
                           worshippers — to think that in these two great nations there should be
                           this terrible and deadly iniquity, and such a vast amount of liquor
                           consumed ; 60,000 in this land, and nearly as many in my own, every year
                           going down to a drunkard's grave — I say to think of all this should stir
                           the heart of every one to help to remove so great amass of evil. It
                           should raise the question, ' What can we do to help it? ' I am
                           endeavouring to do what I can by speaking to you this evening. But some
                           may say, ' We cannot do that, and therefore we can do nothing.' We have,
                           every one of us, influence which we might throw in to aid the efforts of
                           those who are labouring for the suppression of intemperance. If there is
                           ever to be a change in this land or in the United States, in the drinking
                           usages of the people, it will have to commence amongst the religious
                           people and amongst those, who, perhaps, may be called the upper classes.
                           It is of no use to invite the poor drunkard to sign the pledge, if others
                           will not sign it with him. Your names are wanted to give sanction and
                           respectability to the pledge, and to help on the great temperance
                           reformation. The American ladies are doing a great deal in the work. In
                           Michigan much effort has been put forth since I left home, and is highly
                           spoken of by some of our ablest writers and thinkers. The ladies have
                           made a movement of this kind in this and other States. They have met and
                           endeavoured, by their prayers and little meetings, to effect a change for
                           the better in the drinking habits of the people. Some of these ladies are
                           of the highest rank and social position, and I can only bid them
                           God-speed, and hope that they will prosper in their work. It may be that
                           this method of work would not dofortheEnglish people. There they
                           haveadopted eight pledges which have been found very useful. One of them
                           is simply ' We will abstain from the intoxicating draught.' The next is '
                           We will not offer it to others; ' another, ' We will not have it in our
                           homes ; ' the fourth is a declaration which we hand to grocers in the
                           city, requesting them to sign the pledge, and not sell any intoxicating
                           liquors. If they will sign such a pledge, the ladies on their part will
                           sign a pledge that they will deal with them in preference to-jthose who
                           do sell the intoxicating draught. Thus we may help each other very much.
                           Then there is another pledge that is presented to the physician, and a
                           great number have signed it — that they will not prescribe intoxicating
                           liquor if anything else can be found to answer — and the ladies have
                           signed a pledge that they wall prefer such physicians, and such chemists
                           and druggists to any others. There were some Good Templars in Indiana,
                           who were very vigilant and doing a good work amongst the intemperate. A
                           man there was selling liquor against the law, and the Templars prosecuted
                           him, and he was fined for it. When he paid his fine, he went on again,
                           and a second and a third time this was done. The ladies of the place had
                           a prayer meeting, and they thought that something must be done by them.
                           If the men could not prevail by law, they would try and prevail by the
                           Gospel, with love, charity, kindness, gentleness, and the prayer of
                           faith. Four of them used to go every evening and take their seats in that
                           prayer meeting in the place where the liquor was being drunk. They had a
                           little piece of knitting or something that didn't require much thought,
                           and there they sat for hours. They behaved with great courtesy and
                           kindness to the proprietor, and they tried all they could to persuade him
                           to give up his avocation. Whether he would have done so or not is
                           uncertain, but, finding that his craft was in danger and that he could
                           not sell liquor, he was at length prevailed upon to give it up, and
                           commenced business as a butcher, when they did all they could to support
                           him. I think something can be done in that way by the churches. The
                           question was put to Mr. Moody. He has been a friend of mine for eight
                           years, and in Chicago I have used his pulpit several times. The question
                           put to him was with reference to intemperance, and he said, ' There have
                           been more questions in my question drawer on the subject of intemperance
                           than any other.' He came into a meeting in Dublin with a large bundle of
                           papers, all of them about intoxicating drinks. He was asked whether a
                           converted man, who had given his heart to the Lord, could continue to be
                           a distiller, or engage in the selling of intoxicating liquors, and he
                           said, ' I want it to be understood that I stand upon the teetotal
                           platform fair and square. If any man is in doubt whether he is right in
                           selling that which is poison to others, just let him kneel down by a cask
                           of whisky and see whether he can ask God's blessing on his trade, and if
                           he cannot, why that will be his clear and distinct answer. It is not
                           right and lawful to do anything upon which God's blessing cannot be
                           asked.' Then comes the question — ' How are those to get out of the
                           traffic who are engaged in it? ' I have heard of some who are very uneasy
                           because they are in the trade, and they do not know how to get out of it.
                           It seems to me that it is a question the church should take up, so that
                           the burden should not be borne simply by the few. Let each separate
                           branch of the church take it up. I will allude to the Friends especially,
                           because it is the body to which I belong, and because this is their place
                           of worship. Suppose they say, * We do not approve of our members selling
                           or making, intoxicating liquors.' Oh, try to encourage them to give it
                           up, and if some of those members say, ' Well, it is a hard thing for us;
                           it will be sacrificing our whole living and property ; ' let the church
                           take the burden upon itself, and enable them to enter upon something that
                           will give them a blessing; there would be a great gain to the body if
                           this were done.</p>
                        <p>"Certainly, it is trying for persons engaged in the liquor traffic to
                           feel that they cannot ask God's blessing upon it, and when the time of
                           death comes, what a fearful time for them ! How terrible to look forward
                           into the future world for some one who will say, * He tempted me to drink
                           I ' * He made the liquor I drank ! ' Our dear friend, Caroline Talbot,
                           saw a man unloading a cask of whisky, and, in doing so, he hurt his
                           finger. He swore very much at the accident, and C.T. spoke to him. The
                           proprietor of the distillery stepped out as she was about commencing to
                           read to the men a little tract she held in her hand, entitled, ' The
                           Swearer's Prayer.' The employer said, ' These men are in my employ, and I
                           will thank you not to hinder them; their time is precious.' She answered,
                           with a pleasant smile, ' I dare say they are, and that their time is very
                           precious, but I have a tract here, and it will not take long to read,
                           perhaps it will suit thy case as well as theirs.' The gentleman looked on
                           in utter amazement, but remained there until she had finished reading her
                           tract. By that time she had a congregation of some twenty-five or thirty
                           people. She told them she was to speak in the Methodist church in the
                           evening, and invited them all to be present. The man with the hurt finger
                           said ' I will be there,' his employer said the same, and 60 said the
                           others. In the evening she saw them coming into the meeting. It was one
                           to unfold the truths of the Gospel, and she felt, as many ministers do,
                           that it was right to preach of ' righteousness, and temperance, and
                           judgment to come.' Consequently, amongst other things, she preached
                           against intemper- ance, and the still greater iniquity of making money
                           out of that which spread desolation and ruin around, and she used this
                           rather remarkable expression, ' I would rather walk through the streets,
                           and beg my bread from door to door, or sit like Lazarus waiting for the
                           crumbs that fall from the rich man's table, than I would ride through the
                           streets of your city in chariots of gold, drawn by elegant horses
                           purchased with the price of the precious souls of men.' She made a most
                           earnest and thrilling appeal to them, founded on the text, ' What shall
                           it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul
                           or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul ' 1 The result of her
                           faithful pleading was this — many hearts were stirred there, and the
                           distiller shortly after gave up his business, and spent some thousands of
                           dollars of his ill-gotten gold in helping the inebriate asylums, and
                           caring for the widows, wives, and chil- dren of drunkards. There is a
                           very simple text in the Bible that might apply to some one present, 'Go,
                           and do thou likewise.' Through the earnest pleading of that one feeble
                           Christian woman, this change was brought about; through the earnest
                           pleading of the same individual, the little boy's father of whom I have
                           been speaking, was converted under the blessing of God. I must tell you
                           of an incident in connection with our war. It shows the deadly nature of
                           the two great evils of war and intemperance. (Here E.L.C. related the
                           pathetic story of ' Poor Harry,' already given in a former page of this
                           volume.) She continued — I saw two mothers weeping in excessive grief,
                           and one said to me, ' I could have borne it if he had only been killed
                           while doing duty to his country, but,* she said, 'my boy was butchered,'
                           and so said the other mother. I asked what they meant, and amidst their
                           sobs and tears, they told me that the regiment their sons belonged to had
                           been surrounded on three sides by the enemy, who had been pouring into
                           them a hot fire for nearly an hour, and that all the ammunition of the
                           regiment had been spent. What was the reason of that? Why, the general in
                           command had ordered them into that position, and the General was drunk.
                           This required some investigation before I could make any complaint. I
                           therefore made considerable inquiry, and think it was putting the thing
                           too strongly to say he was drunk; but certainly he had drunk sufiicient
                           wine, by his own confession, to have somewhat dimmed his judgment, and
                           that at a time when, humanly speaking, thousands of lives were in his
                           hand. I went to the Secretary of War, and presented this case and two or
                           three others. I stated them as things that ought not to be allowed to go
                           on. Secretary Stanton was a very kind-hearted man, whose mother had been
                           a member of the Society of Friends. His eyes filled with tears as I spoke
                           about the poor widowed mother in Minnesota, and he said, ' My dear madam,
                           I am very sorry that such things should occur, but they are among the
                           terrible exigencies of war. Such things will sometimes happen in the best
                           regulated armies.' I thought what a terrible thing war must be, and if in
                           the best regulated armies such things will inevitably happen, what must
                           happen in the worst ! and my prayer rose up then, and many a time since
                           to this effec : —</p>

                        <p>"It was a very interesting circumstance to me when in Ireland, on a visit
                           which lasted some four months, to hear one day of an order, which had
                           come down from headquarters, that every one of the ministers of the
                           Presbyterian Church should preach a temperance sermon, and should read a
                           manifesto on the same subject. If all the ministers of the gospel would
                           preach of temperance, as well as of righteous- ness, and of judgment to
                           come, and practise it, and then if all the Christian people in the
                           position of those gathered here this evening, would throw in their
                           influence on the right side, there would be very soon a great difference
                           made in the drinking usages of the country. I have visited many wealthy
                           families in Ireland, where I find they are laying aside wine. I do not
                           very often advocate the following of fashion, but should a fashion be
                           started by the wealthy families not to introduce wine on their tables, I
                           think it would be a very good one, and one I would recommend you all to
                           follow. Some say that legislation will do so much, but I am rather of
                           John Bright's opinion, that legislation can do nothing until the minds of
                           the people are more changed, because they will not other- wise carry it
                           out. . . . There must be, on the part of Christian people, a fire of love
                           that is willing to renounce personal interests, tastes and pleasures,
                           and, with the blessing of God on our efforts, the drinking usages of the
                           land will be changed. Supposing the mothers of these 60,000 drunkards who
                           exist in this present year had persuaded their children to sign the
                           pledge when they were young, and they had kept it, what a difference
                           there would be in those 60,000 persons. To those who wish to do the
                           temperance cause a service by circulating literature, I cannot do better
                           than recommend ' The Little Captain,' and ' The Fool's Pence.' I have
                           already heard of eight or ten cases in which the former has been very
                           much blessed. In one large city, I heard of some who had given up the
                           traffic in liquor from reading that book. There is a little incident
                           connected with the tract called ' The Fool's Pence,' which I should like
                           to relate. About twelve or fourteen years ago I was in Indiana, when the
                           agent of the Tract Society was there, who had given me a very liberal
                           supply of publications for gratuitous circulation. He said, ' I want thee
                           to read this tract, and to see whether it is suitable for ns to bring out
                           a reprint of it.' As I was travelling in one of the railway cars, I took
                           out the tract and read it, putting my name in pencil in the corner. A man
                           very much the worse for liquor staggered in, and asked a gentleman near
                           me where they sold liquor. Wishing to get rid of him, he said, ' You will
                           get some at the next shop,' and so the man passed on. As he passed me, I
                           pushed this tract — ' The Fool's Pence ' — into his pocket. A lady saw me
                           and said, ' That is w^hat I call casting pearls before swine. What is the
                           use of giving a tract to a drunken man ?' I told her I had put the tract
                           into the man's pocket with a prayer for a blessing. Eight months passed
                           away, and I was travelling again not fifty miles from that line, and
                           missed connection with the train I wished to take. That gave me three or
                           four hours to wait in the town where I was put down. I walked about for a
                           long time, and as I was returning to the station, I saw a man sitting at
                           a cottage door. He had two little boys beside him, and he was reading a
                           tract. I went to the children to give them a picture-tract, and as I drew
                           near, I observed the man was reading the tract entitled *The Fool's
                           Pence.' It is rather a striking looking tract, with a picture on the face
                           of it. I said to him, ' That is an interesting tract.' ' Yes, very,' he
                           said, and he put it into my hand, and there I saw, in faint pencil marks
                           in the corner, my own name. Then immediately I remembered all about the
                           tract I put into the man's pocket in the car, and I asked * Where did you
                           get that tract ?' He looked a little embarrassed, and I felt at liberty
                           to indulge my curiosity still further. I said to him, ' I do not ask from
                           idle curiosity, but I have seen that tract before.' He said, ' I have
                           never been an habitual drunkard, but three times have been the worse for
                           liquor, and the last time was when I was out on a journey and came home
                           intoxicated; the next day, when I was feeling miserable, I found that
                           tract in my pocket.' He then went on to say that he was not able to go to
                           work that day, and he read and re-read that tract, and after reading it
                           twice he had gone to a neighbour who had before invited him to sign the
                           pledge, and he signed it. It is a very good idea to keep a pledge book in
                           our houses, so as to be useful to our moderate- drinking neighbours. I
                           think if it is introduced kindly they would not take offence, and, more
                           than that, I think that at a time when their hearts are impressed they
                           would come in and sign it. The man also told me that he was bringing up
                           his two boys to be temperance boys. I then said to him, ' I put that
                           tract into your pocket, and that is my name in the corner.' He dropped
                           his tract and got hold of my hand, giving it a squeeze that I felt for
                           some time after. He then said I must come and see his wife, for he said,
                           ' she has prayed for you every night since I read that tract and signed
                           the pledge.' Without knowing who it was, she had prayed for the person
                           who had put that tract into her husband's pocket. ... I do not mention
                           any of these things to show you what ■ I have done for the Lord, for I
                           have done but very little, but what He has done for me, and also because
                           I believe that in speaking thus of what I have done, and seen, and heard,
                           it is more likely to impress you than telling what other people have
                           witnessed and done. I believe every one in this room may do some good in
                           this cause. The first thing to do is, as regards those who have not done
                           it yet, to sign the pledge, and ask the Lord to bless the act, and then
                           endeavour to induce the members of your families to do the same. Some can
                           write a tract that may be a blessing to thousands — such as 'The Little
                           Captain' and 'The Fool's Pence ' have been. Some may say ' I can't
                           write'; no, but you can distribute, I believe everyone can do something.
                           A friend of mine sat at the table of a lady on which the wine cup stood .
                           The lady's son was there, and my friend imagined that he sipped it as
                           though he liked it very much, and put the question to her if she was not
                           afraid of her boy becoming intemperate — he seemed to like it so much.
                           The mother was quite offended, though my friend had spoken to her in a
                           Christian spirit. She said, ' My A. become a drunkard? Impossible ! He
                           knows how to control himself, and when to stop ! ' When my friend wanted
                           to persuade her to let her boy sign the pledge, the mother would not
                           encourage it, but rather laughed at the idea. It was only eighteen months
                           afterwards that that mother was in an agony of grief beside the coffin of
                           her son, who had died in a fit of delirium tremens. He had been of a very
                           genial disposition, and unhappily, those are the people who fall victims
                           most easily to this vice. My friend went to her to try to comfort her;
                           but oh ! dear, it is a hard case in which to give comfort. She was at a
                           loss what to say; the mother almost frantic at one moment, and at another
                           in the most abject grief, amidst floods of tears, said, ' Don't talk to
                           me about comfort when you know that there lies my only son, who has died
                           in delirium tremens. Don't talk to me of comfort when you know that his
                           mother's hand gave him the first glass of wine, and his mother's voice
                           encouraged him to drink when you would have had him abstain.' Then came a
                           fresh burst of grief, ' Don't talk to me of comfort when you know it is
                           written that no drunkard shall inherit the kingdom of God ! ' and my
                           friend had to leave her in her anguish and sorrow. God forbid that any
                           dear mother here should have to feel that her hand has given the first
                           glass of Avine to her child ! There are three young men in the State of
                           Maine who left this country as drunkards, and went there that they might
                           be saved from the constant temptation to drink that assailed them here.
                           They have all of them become reclaimed, and all of them con- verted. One
                           of them is a very able minister of the Gospel; the second speaks
                           frequently in meetings, and with great approval; and the third is an
                           earnest Christian and sober man. What a blessed thing it would be for
                           this land if all the liquor shops were closed here as they are there ! I
                           believe there is something stirring the hearts of the people now, and
                           they only want that we should look to God for direction* From a somewhat
                           enlarged experience, having visited 195,000 sick and wounded soldiers,
                           and seen a great amount of human suffering, I can say that I believe
                           there is nothing so great, so elevating, and so conducive to personal
                           happiness, as endeavouring to cheer and to soothe the afflicted by whom
                           we are surrounded; and indeed there is great truth in the words of one of
                           our American poets : —</p>
                        <p>"' Rouse to some work of high and holy love, And thou an angel's
                           happiness shalt know, Shalt bless the earth, while in the world above The
                           work begun by thee shall onward flow, In many a branching stream, and
                           wider grow. The seed that in these few and fleeting hours, Thy hands
                           unwearied and unsparing sow, Shall deck thy grave with amaranthine
                           flowers. And yield thee fruit divine in Heaven's immortal bowers.' "</p>
                        <p>After the Conference, E.L.C. spent several weeks in Ireland. Writing from
                           Moyallen House, where she was most kindly entertained, on the 22-9-74,
                           she says : I have urgent invitations from Anner Mills, Belfast, Lurgan,
                           Lissue, Lisburn, Mountmellick, Carlow, Waterford, Clara, Dublin, Cork or
                           Bessboro', Bessbrook, and several other places, with earnest
                           representations of the * amount of good w^e might do ' in these various
                           localities. One thing is evident to me, if I undertake to do half the
                           work in Ireland that the Friends seem to be laying out for me, I shall
                           close my pilgrimage here, and have my body deposited in one of their
                           green cemeteries, in this Emerald Isle. . . .</p>
                        <p>"I was much shocked last evening, when seated in an appointed meeting
                           beside John Grubb Richardson. After a few prefatory remarks upon the
                           uncertainty of life, he read a letter from Francis T. King, of Baltimore,
                           announcing the death of my long-loved and valued friend, Robert L.
                           Murray, who was killed by being thrown out of his carriage. Then J.G.R.
                           turned to me and whispered to me to follow it up by some of my striking
                           incidents on the uncertainty of life. I felt too much overcome by the sad
                           tidings to do so for awhile, as I thought of the bereaved wife, one of my
                           dearest friends, and of her j^oung family, and the great loss to New York
                           Yearly Meeting of one of its brightest stars. I think he was, beyond a
                           doubt, the most useful member of New York Yearly Meeting.</p>
                        <p>"We are about to start for Lurgan; return here for another meeting this
                           afternoon; go (D.Y.) to M.E.'s on Sixth-day afternoon, and accompany her
                           to Carlow next day. We have not been to Bessbrook yet, but hope for a few
                           days there after Carlow. I expect to be a week in Dublin."</p>
                        <p>From Crumlin Terrace, Belfast, 15-10-74, E. L. C. writes : — " My
                           proposed * two or three weeks ' are spun out, and when they will end I do
                           not know. I can see no way out of Ireland yet. Meetings with the public
                           every evening this week thus far, and meetings in the large churches in
                           the afternoons with the ladies, keep me fully occupied. The door seems to
                           widen every day. Yesterday two Presbyterian ministers came to request me
                           to use their pulpits, and speak to the ladies of their congregations.
                           To-day a similar request comes from a Bai^tist minister in this city. We
                           have thronged, overflowing meetings every time. It is a great comfort to
                           me to have C. with me, and I daily and almost hourly, while I see and
                           enjoy her, think of thee and thy great loss, and feel more sympathy than
                           words can express for thee in thy lone- liness. I am glad you have had
                           dear D. C. T. and M. R. H., and have been a little cheered by their
                           visit."</p>
                        <p>Writing to a sister from Foxrock, Dublin, 9th of 12th Mo., E. L. C. says
                           :— " This time last year- noon — C. and I were anxiously looking toward
                           the small boat approaching our ship, to see whether any- one we knew was
                           there, with a longing, but scarcely a hope, that we might see a familiar
                           face — then the sight of my dear brother waving his hand and hat, then
                           the loving greeting, the landing, the railway journey, the meeting dear
                           L. and M. looking so bright and well at York, our little visit there, the
                           cheerful Christmas at Darlington. How much has one short year
                           produced!</p>
                        <p>"The joy has been great. The clouds and darkness also great. Perhaps
                           before another year has rolled away, we may be able to see the reason, or
                           the ' need-be ' for some of these trials. Meantime, let us rest in the
                           words 'AH things shall work together for good to them that love the Lord
                           ! ' You will have a sad and lonely Christmas, I should like to spend it
                           with you, but I cannot leave Ireland just yet. There seems a very open
                           field for labour, and an eagerness to hear the Gospel. Our meetings are
                           large, some to overflowing. . . . lam longing for home. Can S. get me any
                           shipping intelli- gence? When we have decided upon the vessel, and
                           secured our passage, we shall seem nearer home. I have good accounts from
                           them all, except that my ' own meeting is dwindling,' and ' we miss thee
                           very much.' . . . Moody's meetings were very much owned and blessed here
                           — sixty young men in the employ of one firm were converted, and they meet
                           every morning at seven o'clock for a prayer meeting, before opening
                           shop.</p>

                        <p>Nearly all the Dublin Friends attended their meetings^ and some came from
                           Waterford, Cork, Clonmel, Wex- ford, and many other parts of the Island
                           to attend. . . . . Dear C.E.T. is daily gaining strength — she expects to
                           attend the General Meeting, to be held at Cork after their Quarterly
                           Meeting next week. I remain here (D.V.) until Seventh-day, when M.E.
                           purposes going with me to Wexford Co. We shall probably continue there a
                           few days or near a week. I do not know at all where I shall spend
                           Christmas, but shall probably be at home in spirit. There will be a
                           family meeting, a large gathering, and I shall long to be there ! May you
                           and T, and C, and dear F. and R., and L., and all of us, who feel
                           stripped and lonely during- the coming Christmas w^eek, find the
                           Comforter very near at hand, and in Him enjoy sweet rest and peace."</p>
                        <p>E.L.C. writes from Plymouth, 20-2-1875 :— " We are having good large
                           meetings. There is a wonderful eagerness on the part of the people here
                           to hear the Gospel message. All classes throng to our meetings. Yesterday
                           morning we visited two schools, 800 boys and 400 girls. They were very
                           attentive. A mothers* meeting in the evening of nearly 400, including
                           some ladies. I did not count them, but give the numbers as they were
                           given to me. ... At noon to-day we have a meeting with ladies. This
                           evening a social religious meeting (with tea at the * British Workman ')
                           with Friends. To-morrow (First-day) the public are invited to Friends'
                           Meeting in the morning. Soldiers are especially invited to an appointed
                           meeting in the evening. Second-day, a.m.. Children's Meeting; p.m.,
                           Temperance Meeting. Third-day, go to Torquay. A.R.W.'s love; she is a
                           most excellent caretaker, and great help to me."</p>
                        <p>From Torquay, 25-2-75 : — " The weather is so cold and foggy that I can
                           see nothing of the scenery of this beautiful spot. I am afraid to stir
                           out of doors, except to ride in a close carriage to the meetings, which
                           are appointed and must be attended. I wish thou wast here. Thy eloquent
                           and stirring description of this spot w^hen thou spent six months here
                           some years ago made me long to visit it. And now that I am here, the
                           weather, and the still susceptible condition of my bronchial tubes,
                           prevent my seeing and enjoying much of it. From what I do see I can form
                           an idea of its exquisite variety and beauty.</p>
                        <p>"Falmouth, 26-2-75. I cannot bear to think of delaying my voyage until
                           the 5th Mo. I am home- sick, and longing to see my dear husband and
                           family again. I have not told J. of the proposed delay, and am hoping '
                           something may turn up ' to prevent. Our meetings in this south land are
                           crowded, and seem satisfactory. We are just going to the ' Ganges,' a
                           training ship for boys, then to the poor-house, and this evening to a
                           large Temperance Meeting."</p>

                     <div type="chapter">
                        <p>I. L. C, with her daughter and little granddaughter, started on their
                           return voyage in the City of Paris," towards the end of April. On the
                           twelfth day at sea, she writes under date 3-5-75 : — My dear sisters,
                           uncle and aunt, and dear friends, I meant to have written an interesting
                           letter or a graphic journal, but alas! 'When I would do good evil is
                           present with me.' When I take the pen it does not follow my will. The
                           table shakes, the steamer rocks, my head swims, and I feel that my letter
                           or journal will be a miserable failure. My dear A. R. Whiting will find
                           that she was greatly mistaken in her estimation of my powers as ' a racy
                           letter- writer.' I have had some hope that C. would be able to make up
                           for my deficiency, but she is as bad or worse than I. Sea-sickness has
                           completely unmanned or univomanned us both. I fear that my description of
                           the horrors of sea-sickness will not encourage the dear young people to
                           accept my invitation to visit our land for a wedding trip. Perhaps the
                           Bessemer Saloon may be in use for crossing the Atlantic by that time, or
                           they may be better sailors than I. Certainly my distress has been such as
                           I would not wish the worst convict in the land to suffer as the penalty
                           for his offence. Query, how would it answer to exchange the prison cell
                           for an ocean voyage? In cases of extreme stubbornness or insubordination
                           it might prove effectual. My poor prisoner at the pumps could never have
                           held out through a voyage like this. I never felt so 7neek in my life, or
                           so utterly unable to resist or oppose. 0 ! those long, weary nights,
                           those days of languor and exhaustion ! After changing my cabin, my head
                           was brought into nearer contact with the engine or the machinery, and the
                           thud, thud, thump, thump, of the engine incessantly, so near me, was
                           distressing beyond measure. Hour after hour, day after day, night after
                           night, the same dull, heavy, monotonous sound. As I lay there, all sorts
                           of scenes passed through my brain. The slavers and slave-trade. The
                           horrors of the poor negroes as they crossed the ocean, not with the
                           comforts offered to us, but chained, and lying as close together as they
                           could be placed. The cry seemed to me to ring in my ears for hours.</p>
                        <p>'By our blood in Afric wasted, Ere our necks received the chain, By the
                           misery that we tasted, Crossing, in your barks, the main. Thud, thud,
                           went the engine, saying, Crossing in your barks the main, in your barks
                           the main, in your barks the main, in your barks the main'; so it seemed
                           to keep on for hours, and I could not get rid of it. Then it would change
                           to 'It seemed that on ocean afloat, Asleep at the dawn of the day, I
                           dreamed what I cannot but sing. So pleasant it seemed as I lay.'</p>
                        <p>And the last line seemed mockingly echoed by the heavy thud of the
                           engine. Meantime we were tossing and pitching in a style that made it
                           difficult to remain in our berths. My phantoms, and visions, and fancies
                           were put to flight by C. rushing into my room in the middle of the night
                           to tell me in alarm that the sea was beating so violently against the
                           window, under which baby was lying, that the water had found an entrance
                           somewhere and the floor was sopping wet. So the night watchman was
                           called. He soon took up the carpet, dried the floor, fixed the leakage,
                           and again we returned to the monotony of the night. To main- tain the
                           perpendicular when out of bed, and the horizontal when in bed, were alike
                           impossible. When in our berths, sometimes the head, sometimes the feet,
                           were in the ascendant, more frequently the latter. This steamer, 'The
                           City of Paris,' is 418 feet long, 40 broad, 69 deep, 3,000 tons burden.
                           Captain Tibbetts has crossed the Atlantic 347 times, and * knows the road
                           well, and understands all the mile- stones,' he says. He is a pleasant
                           man. We hope to reach New York on Fourth-day, and to post this
                           immediately on landing. Dear little C. L. sits beside me reading with the
                           book wrong way up, the most extraordinary miscellany. I quote from her '
                           Mary had a little lamb,' 'What made the lamb love Mary so? Why Mary loved
                           the lamb you know.' Then raising her sweet little baby voice, she sung
                           'There were ninety and nine that safely lay,' &amp;c. Then, 'Jesus loves
                           me, this I know.' The book out of which she pretends to be reading is, '
                           Across the Ferry,' by James Macaulay, editor of ' The Leisure Hour,' a
                           volume we are reading with great interest, 'Across the Ferry' meaning
                           across the Atlantic. Poor child, she has been very ill — I almost feared
                           we should lose her. There seemed nothing she could eat, and the milk did
                           not suit her. She was the first to be ill, the morning after we left
                           Queenstown; and such a quiet, patient, little sufferer. Yesterday, our
                           eleventh day at sea, we were told we were still 700 or 800 miles from New
                           York. The Liverpool Agent told me we should probably arrive on the 1st of
                           May, and it is now the 3rd. It is a wearisome voyage, and has been one of
                           much suffering to us all thus far. * Up to the heights, down again to the
                           depths, our souls melted because of trouble. Then we cried unto the Lord
                           in our trouble, and he delivered us out of our distresses. He made the
                           storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still. Then they are glad,
                           because they be quiet. So He bringeth them unto their desired haven.' A
                           few hours of this quiet we enjoyed yesterday, and went up on deck, and
                           sat under an awning, and one of the stewards brought our little invalid
                           well wrapped up, and carried her about on deck, in the sunshine. It has
                           refreshed her, and done her so much good, and she is smiling again, and
                           her appetite returning. We are so thankful. We are all feeling better,
                           and trust the worst is past, and that our drooping little Lily will
                           revive, and pick up as fast as she lost flesh and strength.</p>

                        <p>"We have 999 steerage passengers on board, reckoning the children, of
                           whom there are a great many. Hundreds came on board at Queenstown — such
                           a set ! In poverty, wretchedness, and dirt. The Purser tells me that they
                           average more than 1,000 per trip during the summer months by this
                           line.</p>
                        <p>"I have suffered more from thirst than on any previous voyage. The tea is
                           poor, coffee poorer, water poorest. I tried lemonade for awhile, but soon
                           tired of it. They offered me wine, brandy, lager beer, porter, Allsopp's
                           pale ale, Guinness' porter, and the whole round of what Moody denominates
                           * infernal drinks.' At length, on the ninth day, we tried gingerade,
                           which the steward assured me I could not get drunk on, if I took a
                           gallon. We were satisfied with a sixpenny bottle per day between us; they
                           called it a pint bottle, but I believe an imperial quart would hold three
                           or four of them. How I wished we had not refused dear C.'s kind offer of
                           raspberry vinegar. I wished for some oranges also. Through ' some
                           unaccountable neglect, the supply ordered and expected were not put on
                           board.' Dear little Calla longed for one often in vain, when she could
                           take nothing else. As I look upon her now, I think of her as she sat at
                           table at Dr. T.'s at Liverpool, the last dinner we took in England. I had
                           asked a blessing closing with ' Jesus Christ, 'our Saviour.' She looked
                           up at me so brightly, and said, ' Dan-ma, I fought you were cooing to say
                           ' Jesus Christ, our Saviour dear,' alluding to the sweet little hymn that
                           her aunt C. and little cousin F. taught her.</p>

                        <p>"'Thou who once on mother's knee Wert a little one like me, Jesus Christ,
                           our Saviour dear, Let me feel thee very near.'</p>
                        <p>Little darling, I am so thankful that she is getting better, and to
                           believe that my last ocean voyage will be over in a few days, llie last,
                           the very last, I hope and believe. I must leave sea voyages to younger
                           persons and better sailors.</p>
                        <p>"First-day. Captain Tibbetts read the Church services in the saloon this
                           morning. We each had a prayer-book. There were forty or fifty steerage
                           passengers present, some of the officers of the ship, and about half of
                           our saloon company. Baby thought she must do her part in the responses,
                           etc. She could not understand what the rest said, and put in a few
                           original touches and irrelevant quotations. As she spoke in a low voice,
                           an occasional sentence reached my ears as under, ' Twinkle, twinkle,
                           little star, how I vonder vot you are. Amen ! ' ' Dere vos a little
                           budder, just five years old, and I've dot four nuts ve captain dave me to

                           Then followed something about 'little tuzin Feddie, and aunt Tarline, and
                           ve bath, and play-room, and rocking-horse, and swing, etc. Amen !' She
                           brought in the 'Amen' whenever she heard others say it.</p>
                        <p>"9 p.m.. Thirteenth day on the sea. — Rainy and foggy, but calm. We took
                           the pilot on board this p.m. Captain T. says they often meet with pilot
                           boats 200 miles from New York. They are sometimes out two or three days
                           watching for the ships. They pay them 250 dollars — £50 — each trip. He
                           thinks he could do very well without one, but in case of an accident, the
                           underwriters might make a stir.</p>
                        <p>C. was reading out of the pretty little testament cousin B. gave her.
                           Baby wanted mamma to give her the tiny, pretty little book, and take the
                           large Bible herself. B. would have been amused at the extraordinary
                           theology the child ' read ' in her sweet baby way out of the said
                           testament. She * read ' in a low tone, and seemed too much absorbed by
                           her subjects to notice whether anyone was listening. 'Jesus' and
                           'heaven,' 'papa' and 'little buzzer, kittens, mittens, and Christ-mas

                        <p>A few lines from her youngest sister, dated New York, May 5th, 1875, told
                           of their arrival. She wrote, "A few hasty lines just to let you all know
                           that our darling trio are safe here, all looking well. They had a long,
                           tedious, sea-sick, cold passage, but a safe one. A telegram was handed to
                           me between five and six o'clock a.m. saying the * City of Paris ' would
                           be ' in ' at ' 6.15.' I was about four miles from the wharf, but was soon
                           very wide awake, and at twenty minutes before eight stood on the quay, to
                           which the boat was then slowly approaching, near enough to see our wee
                           dear Calla, who was on deck in one of the officer's arms, looking so
                           bright and pretty. They are all going on to Canada about six p.m., so, as
                           I have just told dearest E., I have only three or four hours in which to
                           do eighteen months' talking, I will stop writing till after my return to

                        <p>"The intelligence conveyed by dear L.'s letter of the removal of our dear
                           Aunt was not unlooked for, though it seemed rather sudden at the last.
                           Dear patient sufferer ! it would not be to her too sudden a summons. It
                           must have been a delightful change. My spirit has seemed at times to rise
                           and participate in her joy. ' First and foremost ' in that most blessed
                           moment when she saw Jesus, her Saviour and Redeemer, then the meeting and
                           greeting with loved relatives and friends. Our dear mother and father.
                           Uncle D., dear M.C., would doubtless be among the first to meet and
                           welcome her, and to enquire what news she had brought of her dear parents
                           and loved ones. Aunt would tell that her dear mother was with her but a
                           few days ago, and how she looked, and what she said, and how she was
                           bearing up under her trial and bereavement, and whether she is preparing
                           to join and live with her in her new and delightful home. Although I
                           doubt not that your dear M. has often seen you, yet such I imagine would
                           be a part of their converse, and the loving daughter would delight to
                           talk with one who had so recently seen her dear mother. Did C. send any
                           message to M. by Aunt? How they will enjoy visiting each other now,
                           walking in the woods, admiring the flowers and gardens, sitting down in
                           those bowers of beauty, watching the birds of Paradise, listening to the
                           rippling cascades or the cataracts, in comparison with which Niagara
                           would sink into insignificance, enjoying together the summer fruits, the
                           grapes more luscious and finer than the grapes of Eshcol. How these
                           re-united portions of families will have family gather- ings, and
                           converse together over the love and the mercy that have led and gathered
                           them safely home. The trials they have passed through will now seem to
                           them indeed as comparatively 'light affliction and but for a moment,' in
                           comparison with the ' far more exceeding and eternal weight of
                           glory.'</p>

                           mind is often with you, and memory busy recalling the pleasant hours we
                           have spent together in the past, and imagination picturing the future. I
                           find myself constantly querying, how is it with you in the present? I
                           hope you are sustained in peace^ even though you may feel at times that
                           the joy and brightness have fled from your home. I have often in seasons
                           of sorrow taken comfort from the remembrance that it was in a season of
                           heavy affliction, and not in the time of prosperity that our loving, com-
                           passionate Saviour left the sweetest legacy of ' Peace ' to his sorrowing
                           little band of followers. May peace be your portion, and consolation from
                           the Lord, until the rapidly revolving wheel of time brings you to the
                           joyful and triumphant reunion, which shall never again know a painful
                           parting. Grace, mercy, and peace be with you. Very mysterious and
                           unaccountable to us are some of the dealings of our Heavenly Father's

                           suffering and helplessness, his dear wife's sorrow. Your dear M.'s

                           of usefulness, leaving a feeble mourning widow and a large family. These
                           things seem to us inscrutable, and truly ' past finding out.' Yet, as we
                           look back upon the past, we find it has been so in past ages, and the
                           Lord hSiS per ))u'tted, if he has not ordered these things; and he has
                           brought blessings out of heart-breaking griefs to his own trusting
                           children. Jacob mourning over his son, Joseph's hard lot and undeserved
                           imprisonment. Daniel being carried away from the home of his childhood,
                           from his beloved fatherland, and the persecution, even to the lion's den.
                           These and many more records of the past show clearly that the Lord can
                           and will bring good out of evil, to those who suffer, trusting in Him,
                           and to give us con- fidence for the future in the precious promise, ' All
                           things shall work together for good to those that love the Lord.'</p>

                           The intense heat has passed away, and now it is genial and pleasant, the
                           thermometer ranging from sixty-eight to seventy-five degrees in this
                           room, where J. and I spend a good deal of our time when at home. The room
                           has four windows, which we keep open day and night in fine weather. The
                           prospect is pleasant. Our 'door yard' (I wish thou could suggest another
                           name) looks beautiful just now. The trees, every one planted by my dear
                           husband's own hand, all looking well. Towards the north we see Norway
                           spruce, lilachs, mountain ash, and in the distance, along the front line
                           by the road, six tall poplars. The birds of many-coloured plumage, bright
                           yellow, green, red, blue, &amp;c., add to the liveliness and variety of
                           beauty. Looking towards the east, we have the early morning sun, fine
                           evergreens, and beyond, the orchard and gardens for small fruits; on the
                           west, Scotch pines, interspersed with sumachs, and in the background some
                           handsome maples. Three weeping willows at the gates look graceful and
                           pretty. We enjoy this room very much. ... I wish you could come and see

                           recently. . . . Since writing the above I have had a visit from a

                           Meetings in Adrian, Hillsdale, and two other towns in this State, and
                           have received two letters also with invitations to two Camp Meetings in
                           Martha's Vineyard and Maine, with the offer of free passes over the

                           preparing a certificate from -our Select Yearly Meeting to London and
                           Dublin, for Eli and Abarilla Cowgill, who feel drawn to visit the small

                           the committee with me to prepare said certificate. They had their

                           Continent of Europe as usual, but withdrew the latter part at my
                           suggestion, and with the cordial unity of the Select Meeting. I had not
                           met with them previously, though a member of the same Yearly Meeting. I
                           think they may be very acceptable in some of your small meetings, and in
                           labouring in some of your missions. . . . 7-9-75. My letter progresses
                           slowly, I cannot tell thee how difficult it is to me to sit down quietly

                           people take me to be a person of leisure, and so come and lay their
                           burdens upon me, and make prolonged calls, and ask for my help in various
                           ways. ' I wanted some one to write a letter for me,' said one neighbour,
                           'and I thought I would come to you, because you can write so easy, and so
                           much better than I can, and I knew you didn't have any baking, or
                           cooking, or washing to do/ ' My wife is a person of leisure,' said my
                           good husband to another. ' She has no liousehold cares, and she likes to
                           make herself useful.' Letters come pouring in about Temperance, Mission
                           Work, Sabbath School Con- ventions, Centennial arrangements, &amp;c.,
                           many that I cannot pretend to answer. During the Yearly Meeting they put

                           all, they have appointed me ' Solicitor,' to beg funds for re- building

                           have a long weari-some journey, but I trust, with the Lord's presence and
                           his blessing, we shall find our strength equal to our day. We expect to
                           be in that desperately wicked city two weeks. We propose to hold tw^o
                           meetings daily, one of w^iich will be in the churches of the city each
                           evening, the other with the various workers in the Mission and Temperance
                           work, or public prisons and institutions. In addition to this, we hope to
                           gather together into a compact body, the scattered Friends in and around
                           the city, and to organize them into a good Friends' meeting I am here now
                           at the celebrated Women's Prison for this State of Indiana, the best

                           friend, Sarah J. Smith, formerly of Sheffield, a valued minister of our
                           Society. It was considered quite an experiment to place a woman at the
                           head of such an establishment, but S.J.S. has been here two years, and it
                           has proved a complete success. The voice of love and gentleness, of
                           sympathy and womanly kindness has proved far more eflFectual in
                           controlling, winning, and reforming women and girls than all the
                           harshness, strength, and power of the sterner sex. Indiana is proud of

                           Convention in Cincinnati. The Committee of Arrangement met on the 17th
                           instant. The Convention proper had three sessions, besides a prayer
                           meeting of one hour each day, and a children's meeting. Seventeen ladies
                           preached in pulpits in the city on First-day, some of us three or four
                           times — so that this city of 300,000 has been pretty thoroughly moved
                           during the past week. One evening was given up for young hidies to speak
                           to young ladies, who were to invite their young gentlemen acquaintance
                           and friends to come with them. A thousand or more of these had the front
                           seats, about a thousand older behind them. The platform was occupied by
                           young ladies only, who, with the greatest 'proiwiet\j and grace,
                           addressed the audience. There was enough of girlish diffidence to add to
                           the charms of youth and beauty, wit and genius. I had no idea of the
                           amount of talent, culture, intellectual power, and deep religious feeling
                           employed in this crusade until now. I felt myself as a grassliopper in
                           their midst. The most wonderful feature in the Convention was the
                           religious element. We can call it nothing less than the Holy Spirit's
                           power. M. C. J., a dear Chris- tian woman, heretofore averse to woman's
                           appearance in public, is one of the leaders, and one of the ablest
                           speakers. She is at the head of the work in Brooklyn, New York, where the
                           ladies have visited 2,000 or 3,000 of the saloons, and 1,000 of them have
                           been closed through their efforts in one year. She works in a very
                           lady-like way, a way that would suit the English Avorkers, not as the

                        <p>"We have appointed a Lecture Bureau, w^hose business it will be to
                           arrange for lectures to be delivered by suitable and able persons at

                           working all over the land. I am on a committee for securing one day in
                           connection with the coming Centennial for an International Temperance

                           to come and take part; please inform her of the same, and that she must
                           not fail to appear.</p>
                        <p>"One lady spoke thus at the Convention, 'I have spent twenty-five years
                           of my life rocking the cradle, and caring for the babies, &amp;c., so you
                           must not expect much from me as a public speaker.' Then she went on to
                           tell us that she had nine sons and two daughters, that she sometimes
                           learned much from them, and from a little two-and-a-half year old baby
                           boy she had learned a sweet lesson. He had been playing for hours in the
                           sand with another little one, and when she had l)rought him in, and taken
                           off the little shoes, and shaken out the sand, and taken off the little
                           socks, and done the same with them, and given him his bath, and put on
                           his clean white night-dress, she heard him repeat his little prayer, '
                           Now I lay me down to sleep.' Then she sung to him, ' I want to be an
                           angel,' talked awhile about the angels and the beautiful home in heaven,
                           and asked if he would not like to go up to heaven and be a beautiful
                           angel there. ' No,' he said, ' he wants to be a booful angel down here in
                           de sand and dirt.' The mother pondered the baby's words, and felt that
                           she must be as an angel in the dirt, in the rough and dark places, and
                           work for Him among those whom He died to save.</p>
                        <p>"There were about twenty or twenty-five very able speakers at this

                        <p>Writing to one of her sisters from Rollin, 19-7-76, E. L. C. gives some
                           idea of the domestic difficulties sometimes experienced in the homes of
                           the far West at that time.</p>
                        <p>"I do not wonder that thou wast surprised at Lina's coming here, seeing
                           thou hast not been with us during the past few weeks, and dost not know
                           the time we have had in getting a ' help,' or trying to get one. R. had
                           the measles two months ago, and C. sent her home to be nursed; L. had
                           them at the same time, and C. could not nurse them both, and could not
                           get help. Servants are very scarce here. I was in Adrian lame at the time
                           To give thee an idea of how they were perplexed, I will describe some of
                           John Harkness's efforts, and the result thereof. He left his
                           corn-planting, and rode three miles to get girl No. 1. She ' was not
                           strong, and feared the work would be too hard for her.' He returned home,
                           and set out for No. 2, in an opposite direction. Being very fniich urged,
                           No. 2 consented as a great favour, to oblige him for two or three days.
                           At the end of the three days he had to take No. 2 home again, and go in
                           quest of No. 3, who never hired out except just once in awhile to earn
                           money to buy herself a new dress or pair of shoes, and upon great urging
                           consented to come for a week. Then she must be taken home. No. 4 came for
                           two weeks, and could not possibly stay longer. No. 5 came for one week.
                           Her mother was sick, and she had to go and take care of her. A ride of
                           eight miles in a very busy time (on the farm) to fetch her, and another
                           to take her home. Finally, we heard of D. H., a girl of some pretensions,
                           whom we were given to understand it would be a great favour if we could
                           get. After some enquiry, hearing from her mother that she would be glad
                           to come and stay some months, J. went at the time appointed, eight miles
                           for her, over desperate roads — in vain; she was not ready, but if he
                           would come again in a few days, she would return with him. Back again
                           over the eight miles of bad road he came, and returned bringing D. H. and
                           her trunk. Almost the first thing she said after entering the hotise was,
                           ' I shall have to get J. to take me home again on Saturday afternoon, as
                           we expect company Sunday.' Poor J., he could not help himself, he must
                           have this sixteen miles' travel again after she had given us four days of
                           her valuable services I He took her home; on her return on First- day
                           evening, she informed C. that she must go home next Saturday and stay a
                           week. This girl. No. 6, Avent home for the week, charged two-and-a-half
                           dollars per week for her services, spoiled two batches of bread, and
                           proved herself very incompetent in many ways. . . . And thus it came
                           about that we asked Lina to ' come over and help us,' which she did."</p>

                           the new Meeting-house at Olens Falls would not at all accommodate the de-
                           votional meetings, so there was a tent borrowed or hired of the
                           Methodists at Round Lake. It was a beautiful sight to see the tent filled
                           with 2,000 worshippers, and to hear their voices singing 'Rock of Ages,'
                           'All hail the power of Jesus' name!' &amp;c. The first meeting in the
                           morning usually commenced at 8 or 8.30 Frequently we were in the
                           Meeting-house or tent nine or ten hours a day. This would have been too
                           much for thee, but S. would have enjoyed it, I think. Among the earnest,

                           four meetings daily, and the effort to do the amiable out of meeting in
                           the houses of our kind entertainers, is as much as I am equal to. We are
                           now at Newport, Rhode Island. This Yearly Meeting lies between
                           Philadelphia and New York in the scale of progress. In New York the

                           overseers, and all 'concerned Friends.' Not so here.</p>
                        <p>To-day we had a discussion two hours long on singing, introduced by a
                           very conservative Friend, who wished that this Yearly Meeting should
                           legislate that there be no singing allowed in West-town School. They
                           could not carry their point. A. K. S. has so successfully * run the
                           school ' for several years; it is full, pros- perous, and self-sustaining
                           under his administration, and the desire of the masses was, manifestly,
                           that he should not be interfered with. The conservatives had to give up
                           the point, with as good a grace as they could.</p>

                           R.H.'s house, to write to thee. Isaac H. came for me to attend the
                           funeral of L.'s father. He died in his ninety-sixth year. He made a very
                           peaceful close. His last words were 'It's all right.' But he was not a
                           believer in the Christian faith. 'A sceptic' they called him, 'an
                           infidel,' and sometimes he would not hesitate, in a moment of excitement,
                           to use a 'gentlemanly' oath. Bright and clear in his faculties to the
                           last, and sight and hearing good. The father of eleven children, ten of
                           whom are still living, lawyers, doctors, &amp;c. They speak very highly
                           of their deceased father. I felt in a difficulty how to act. He had for
                           many years had a prejudice against the Methodists, and a long-standing
                           objection to them.</p>
                        <p>"His request and that of his family was that I would come and preach his
                           funeral sermon. After some prayerful thought, I chose three texts instead
                           of one. First, 'God is love'; second, 'He is the Saviour of all men,
                           especially of them that believe'; and third, the dying words of the
                           departed, 'It is all right.' While upholding the Christian standard, and
                           the doctrine of the Atonement, as my own faith and creed, I dwelt upon
                           the love of God, the great comfort I take in my Bible and my faith, and
                           how earnestly I could commend the same to all present who do not yet
                           enjoy them.</p>
                        <p>"I then addressed myself particularly to the high professors present, on
                           the duty of Christian charity and toleration, &amp;c., &amp;c."</p>

                        <p>AS the country slowly settled down after the war, it became evident that
                           the fact of even so desirable a result as the abolition of slavery,
                           following from such a cause, was not immediately the great boon which the
                           ardent Abolitionists of the North had ventured to anticipate. Even with
                           all the efforts which the Xorth so generously put forth to soothe the
                           wounded feelings of the conquered South, while they firmly endeavoured to
                           check any tendency to treat with harshness the now liberated slaves, it
                           seemed impossible to control altogether the feelings of the former
                           masters. A sentiment of distrust and apprehension spread among the
                           coloured population in the South, which led to a very extensive
                           emigration towards the Xorth; and the then new State of Kansas was
                           regarded as the land of promise to which the alarmed Freedmen directed
                           their steps. They arrived in that State in such numbers, and in so
                           destitute a condition, that the somewhat sparse population then resident
                           there were utterly unable to cope with the situation. Elizabeth Comstock
                           felt impelled at once to proceed to Kansas, and to put forth her earnest
                           efforts to meet the emergency. She found Governor St. John ready to co-
                           operate in the work, and to give all the assistance which his position
                           enabled him to afford. Appeals for aid in money and clothing were widely
                           distributed, and help came from all parts of the Northern States, and
                           also from England, owners of vessels off ering to convey the gifts free,
                           and the American government exempting the goods from duty, while the
                           railway companies con- veyed them without cost to the new homes of the
                           freedmen. The labour involved was continuous and arduous, and though much
                           discomfort, and even dis- tress, could not be avoided, the coloured
                           people gradually settled down, either finding employment, or supporting
                           themselves on the lands allotted to them. E.L.C. found much satisfaction
                           in being enabled to assist in this good work, and only returned to her
                           home when the difficulties of the position were mostly overcome.</p>
                        <p>Writing from Topeka, 31-10-79, E.L.C. says, " C. rides out every day, and
                           walks as much as her strength is equal to, going round to see the poor
                           refugees, enquiring into their wants, and seeking to alleviate them as
                           much as she possibly can. It is pitiful to see them going about the
                           streets, shivering and in rags, and it is delightful to be able to see,
                           in many cases, the rags laid off, and warm, clean clothes put on. Through
                           the liberality of our friends in different parts of the land, we have
                           received large supplies of secondhand clothes and bedding, (some of these
                           are very old, but clean and well mended), old bed quilts re-covered,
                           &amp;c. More than a thousand warm bed covers have been sent, and 4,000 or
                           5,000 articles of clothing, including those for babies, which are in
                           great demand. A company of a little over 200 emigrants from Missouri have
                           thirty- seven Kansas babies, and their mothers are so proud that they are
                           'natives of this good State.' I am concerned to see by our papers that so
                           many English farmers are emigrating to Texas. . . . They will be almost
                           beyond the reach of civilization, and the climate will be too hot for
                           them. I think they would do much better in Kansas. The one great trouble
                           that American farmers have to contend with is the high price they and
                           their wives have to pay for wages to farm labourers and domestics. This
                           evil will be remedied in this State by the coloured emigrants. The
                           labourers will be well paid, and well satisfied here with half what they
                           want in Michigan, and the coloured people make the very best of household
                           servants. ..."</p>
                        <p>Under date 4-1-1880, E.L.C. writes again from Kansas. " Thy welcome Xew
                           Year's greeting came duly to hand with the very pretty cards. . . Canst
                           thou get me a few more of the black hand grasping the white one. If not
                           too costly, I should like to have fifty of them. Some of our coloured
                           friends will greatly value one, if I can give them one. and our noble
                           Governor (St. John) admired it so much. I should like to give him
                           one.</p>
                        <p>"' And the tyrants of the slave land shall tremble at that sign I ' Oh,
                           those tyrants, the cruelties they are practising upon these poor people
                           still, it makes one's blood run cold to hear of. Poor, gentle, timid,
                           meek, inoffensive sufferers ! It is pitiful, mean, contemptible, of their
                           oppressors, who are great cowards. Our indignation is aroused, and our
                           warmest sympathy awakened daily. Many thanks to S. for his care about the
                           crates of crockery. I had hoped before this to be able to acknowledge
                           their safe arrival, but they have not reached Topeka yet. Some of our
                           packages have been delayed by snow drifts. Freight trains are switched
                           off, and left on side tracks, for express and passenger trains to pass,
                           as we have no double tracks west of New York State. I think I wrote S.
                           that W.D.M., the New York agent of Bristol S.S. Line, has passed them
                           through the Custom House with paying a mere nominal duty, and secured
                           free transportation to this city, and we hope very soon to receive them
                           without any charges, and a wonderful boon they will be ! Hundreds of the
                           refugees are utterly destitute of plates, bowls, cups and saucers,
                           pitchers, &amp;c. In case of sending us any more, it may be well to omit
                           tea-pots, sugar basins, and the handles of cups. These poor refugees have
                           neither sugar nor tea. With these exceptions, we shall probably be
                           thankful to have the crockery crates duplicated. We can tell better when
                           we have unpacked them, and seen the condition they are in There is great
                           suffering among the refugees now. Feet and fingers frozen. Cramped and
                           distorted limbs with rheumatism, coughs, colds, pneumonia and dysentery,
                           and we greatly fear famine fever will follow. They come faster than we
                           can shelter them. Half starved, half clad, full of fear and distress,
                           they come and ask for help and protection."</p>

                           when thy letter was handed me. I feel deeply for the fugitives from the
                           oppression of the South, and have already given as large a sum as I could
                           well afford, to aid them. Our contributions here were mostly sent to the
                           committee at St. Louis. Our lamented Wm. L. Garrison, before his death,
                           solicited subscriptions, and I think $1,000 was raised, but where it was
                           sent I am not aware.</p>
                        <p>"It is to be hoped that the emigration will not continue through the cold

                           you. There has been so much to do that had to be done, or someone must
                           suffer, that I have felt as though my small talents should be made the
                           most of in alleviating the suffering of the poor refugees as far as I was
                           able.</p>
                        <p>"We are not quite so crowded now, as we have been sending off and finding
                           homes for about 180 a day for a fortnight, and now they are not
                           uncomfort- ably packed in at the barracks as they have been nearly all
                           winter. We have a hospital built now, and divided into two rooms, one for
                           the men, the other for the women; we have good nurses, and all that are
                           willing to go into the hospital when they are ill get good care and
                           attention, a clean and comfortable place with a cot for each. There are
                           some who have a prejudice, and think if they are taken to the hospital
                           they will be sure to die, but most of them go willingly. One woman died
                           after much suffering, leaving a vej'y tiny baby two weeks old, she had
                           the measles and afterwards pneumonia. The poor little babe being left
                           without any father or mother, I found a nice coloured woman who had no
                           children and was anxious to adopt a little one, so I made necessary
                           arrangements, provided it with clothes, and she is very fond of it, and
                           will feel towards it as though it was her own — it will not lack love or
                           care, poor little thing, I never saw such a tiny baby — it is named '
                           Caroline De Greene Swanson ' by Mrs. Swanson its adopted mother. One poor
                           man has recently died, also his daughter and grandchild. Their story is
                           very sad, the poor man was worn out with nursing, and anxiety, and
                           disappoint- ment, because his money was all gone and he could not get a
                           home as he had hoped, and his family were all ill. His widow is still
                           ailing — I hope she will not follow. There is a little girl at the
                           barracks named 'Susan Nebuchadnezzar Love.' There was a boy not long
                           since called ' Bayliss August Sixteenth Peg,' another 'John Richard
                           Atwell Louisville,' several of the black baby girls have been named
                           Elizabeth Comstock' (or Cornstalk), and a great many baby boys have been
                           honoured with the name of 'Abraham Lincoln.'"</p>

                        <p>Topeka. Kanms, 9-2-1880. "My warmest sympathy is drawn out towards these
                           poor, down-trodden, long-oppressed, and long- suffering people. Day after
                           day we hear their sad, pitiful stories of their wrongs and sufferings. We
                           wrote thee a few weeks ago of a very touching letter written by a company
                           of refugees, sixty-six families, who had fled away from Southern Texas,
                           and when they had travelled hundreds of long weary miles, and arrived
                           within 200 of this city, their supplies all gone, weather intensely cold,
                           they wrote to Governor St. John, entreating him to help them. The letter
                           was enough to move every reader to tears. He could not help them. I could
                           not rest night or day for thinking of them, and said to the Governor, 'I
                           feel as though I must go to them and help them.' 'It would be as much as
                           your life is worth,' was his reply. I entreated him to send them help, or
                           to try to devise some means to aid them. He said he had no funds for the
                           purpose, and that it would take thousands of dollars, for he had had
                           another letter from another company, of ninety- seven families, 300 or
                           400 miles away, and that if we could keep all that came here from
                           starving and freezing, we should do well. The poor, emaciated, ragged,
                           barefoot remnant of that company has reached our Southern boundary in a
                           most distressed condition, hungry, shivering, many with hands and feet
                           frozen; with sad hearts and weeping eyes, they tell of their sufferings
                           on the roads, and of five of their company who were left in the
                           wilderness, frozen to death ! And yet they do not repent leaving the
                           South. Nothing would induce them to go back. I send you a clipping from a
                           ' Boston Transcript.' You will see there an extract from a private letter
                           of C.'s, about a poor man she was much interested in, in ' Utesy,' who
                           had spent his all in coming from the South, and bringing a number of his
                           friends and neighbours with him. Exposure by the way, trouble and sorrow,
                           produced sickness, which was augmented by the want of fresh air and
                           comfort in our crowded barrack, and he died there a few days ago. His
                           poor wife and daughter, forlorn, ill, penniless, and among strangers, are
                           greatly to be pitied. They have known better days, and were pretty well
                           off for coloured ])eople in the South. Yet they do not wish to return.
                           They are glad that they are in a free State, where the laws are the same
                           for white and coloured, and where they will be treated as human beings,
                           and be free to speak and act. Three women are here, whose husbands are in
                           Southern Penitentiaries, for what, think you? Because they voted the
                           Republican ticket, they were turned off by their employers, and then
                           before they could get employment were arrested as vagrants. They all
                           three lived near together, and entreated their wives to bring the
                           children and flee for their lives, and when they reached Kansas to get
                           Governor St. John to help them out of prison!" </p>
                        <p>The following letter from Susan T. Perry to E.L.C.'s sister, tells
                           something of her work at this time:</p>
                        <p>Topeca, Kansas, April 16th, 1880.</p>
                        <p>"Dear Friend,</p>
                        <p>"Your clear sister, Mrs. Elizabeth Comstock, wished this morning that she
                           could find time to write to you, and tell you some of the many
                           interesting facts connected with her work among the coloured refugees.
                           But there are so many demands upon her hands and heart, that she cannot
                           possibly get a leisure moment to devote to those so dearly loved by her,
                           and so often in her thoughts. Could you be here one day, and see the many
                           duties that are constantly calling for her immediate presence and
                           counsel, yoti would not wonder that she does not find time to write her
                           dearest friends.</p>
                        <p>"Indeed, we all feel that the Lord has given her a double portion of His
                           Spirit and grace, and endowed her with almost superhuman physical
                           strength; she accomplishing much more than ten ordinary persons could.
                           Mrs. Comstock went a few weeks ago, at the request of the Governor of
                           this State, to Illinois, and held a meeting in Farwell Hall, in the city
                           of Chicago, to try to induce the people of that State to open the way for
                           large numbers of these coloured emigrants that are literally filling
                           Kansas to overflowing. The result of her meeting there was very
                           satisfactory, as the people in that State resolved to take 50,000 of the
                           coloured emigrants, and assist them in getting places of employ- ment.
                           After her return from Illinois, she went to Nebraska, at the request of
                           the Governor, and has succeeded in turning some of the tide of emigration
                           into that State. It is now contemplated making another headquarters for
                           relief at a point in Nebraska, called White Cloud, which lies near the
                           line of three States, Kansas, Nebraska, and Missouri. It is impossible to
                           find homes and employment for the large coloured population that are
                           coming.</p>
                        <p>"Although the objective point in all the minds of the coloured race is
                           Kansas, yet, by persuasion and offers of steady work, many are induced to
                           believe that there are other States as good to live in as Kansas.
                           Thousands of coloured refugees have found places of employment in
                           different localities, through the efficient workers in our Relief Office.
                           It is besieged all day long with dusky faces imploring for relief in some
                           form. Some of their tales are pitiful in the extreme. They all tell the
                           same story of cruelty, wrong, and oppression at the South. There are no
                           laws there to protect the black man, no equal rights for him. His labour
                           is poorly compensated, and many cannot get their wages at all.</p>
                        <p>"All the coloured refugees who come here are anxious to earn money enough
                           to send back after their friends. I will quote you from a letter a poor
                           man brought to us to read, he cannot read himself. It is from his wife, '
                           I am well in health, but not in mind to think that I cannot see you —
                           there is no chance for me to come to you unless you send me the money —
                           please send me word whether you can borry any money, or hire me out to
                           someone to work, and I can pay it when I come — times is hard here, do
                           money to be had an' nine children to feed. If you don't send me no money,
                           I will have to hire myself to some farmer, it seems as if you might hire
                           me and Andrew out to somebody up there, and get the money. The fare is
                           forty-one dollars for each person. Tell me whether you are trying to pray
                           — there isn't an hour past but what I pray for you — times is serious
                           with us. I don't know what minit I may be taken away, and what will the
                           poor little things do without me? Pray, my dear husband, pray, for the
                           Lord is so good to us, for though we are so many miles away. He can
                           permit us to meet again. Kiss this letter for me. I kisses your letter.
                           With much love, good-bye I Your devoted wife.'</p>
                        <p>"Another letter came to Mrs. Comstock yesterday from a coloured preacher
                           who is very anxious to get his wife here. He says: —</p>
                        <p>'Dear Sister in Christ,</p>
                        <p>'The object of this letter is one of great importance to me. I was
                           obliged to leave Texas clandestinely last Spring to save my life, leaving
                           my poor wife and daughter behind. Since that time I have tried in vain to
                           get money enough to send to them, to bring them here. I am a minister of
                           the Gospel, and was assigned to do mission work here among the poor
                           freedmen. I cannot do my full duty here, while my heart is so burdened,
                           knowing that my poor wife is suffering. I beg of you to assist me in
                           getting her away from that rebel stronghold. She has been very ill — I
                           must care for her. Shall I return to the rebels' land to die with my
                           wife? or will you help me to brin^ her to the land of liberty? My wife is
                           a useful mother in the Sabbath School. Unless I can succeed in bringing
                           my family away, I must return to them and share their fate. Help me, and
                           God will bless you. — Yours in distress.'</p>
                        <p>"To a heart so sympathetic as your beloved sister's, these distressing
                           appeals weigh upon her, and cause her many tears and sleepless hours. It
                           is impossible to do many things for these poor people, because the money
                           sent is only sufficient to keep them from starving and freezing, and to
                           pay their railway fares to different localities, where employment is
                           offered them. There has been a great deal of sickness among them, our
                           doctors' bills and undertakers' bills have been enormous.</p>
                        <p>"At the present time we have a coloured preacher, W. 0. Lynch, a very
                           bright and capable man, at Cairo, a point where the coloured refugees are
                           transferred on their way to Kansas. He is making a strong effort to turn
                           some of the tide of emigration into other States. Mrs. Comstock is
                           expecting a summons to Washington any day to give her testimony regarding
                           the exodus to the Investigation Committees assembled there. If she goes,
                           her daughter will go with her. Mrs. C. de G. and her little C.L. are here
                           with Mrs. C. . . . Now I must beg your attention to a few commissions
                           about the English goods. They came to us in good order, and at a time
                           when they were greatly needed. I have attempted to write to every name
                           that I found enclosed in the bale, if there were an address attached to
                           it. I may have omitted some, if so, and you hear anything relative to it,
                           please assure them of our gratitude and thanks. R.H. is one name; I could
                           not write to for want of her address. If you know her will you please
                           notify her that her generous donation was received, and is already doing
                           good service among these unfortu- nate and destitute people. ... I cannot
                           begin to tell you how much good the valuable and serviceable goods from
                           the dear English Friends did us, and how gratefully they were received by
                           us all. We did enjoy the bags, pincushions, and needlebooks so much. The
                           bags were a novelty in this country. The women and girls were
                           enthusiastic in their expressions of delight. We would be thankful for a
                           few thousands of these bags, fitted up with articles for sewing. Mrs. C.
                           wishes me to say that J.J.'s bale was very valuable, also the York
                           packages. Mrs. de G.'s visits to the sick, suffer- ing, and dying have
                           been very comforting. Many a ' God bless you ' has come to her from dying
                           lips. Truly yours, Susan T. Perry."</p>

                        <p>"When we left Topeka last week the weather was oppressively warm, and
                           here it is cool enough for us to enjoy a fire. I often long for an
                           English climate, where these sudden changes and extremes of heat and cold
                           are not known. I hope thou art enjoying a quiet rest with the comforts of
                           thy new home ! . . . I like York Meeting very much, and am glad thou art
                           located in that famous old city. Tell me how thou spends thy time. . . .
                           One of the greatest treats to me when weary, is to sit clown with my
                           knitting, and have L. A. or C. read to me. It used to be L. A., now it is
                           C. They are both very pleasant, easy readers. Dear L. A., shall I ever
                           see her again? I often think of her in my Kansas work, she would so enjoy
                           it, if healthy and strong. Every
